Design 16
how 27

in 2719
love 29
with 34
one 19

you 29

visit 14
him 9
as 509
soon 3
as 509

I 4330
do 814
not 85
pretend 7
to 805

anything 3
now 10
When 6

up 194
she 199
to 805
give 15
over 596
of 109
her 181
own 9
In 2719
a 6799
woman 21
has 41
not 85
often 4
to 805
think 8
of 109
But 82
my 90
dear 15
you 29
must 28
go 500
and 51
see 70
Mr 5
when 6
he 962
comes 4
into 26
the 193
It 67
is 124
more 11
than 22
I 4330
engage 6
for 484
I 4330
assure 6
you 29
But 82
consider 13
your 4

what 14
an 970
establishment 3

Sir 22
William 3
and 51
Lady 18

for 484
us 70
to 805
visit 14
him 9
if 8
you 29
do 814
not 85
You 29
are 12
over 596
scrupulous 4
I 4330
dare 15
say 7
Mr 5

be 1200
glad 30
to 805

assure 6
him 9
of 109
my 90
consent 5
to 805
his 43
he 962
of 109
the 193
though 12
I 4330
must 28
throw 14
in 2719
a 6799
good 28
word 26
for 484
my 90
little 6
I 4330
desire 6
you 29
will 39
do 814
no 896
thing 15
is 124
not 85
a 6799
bit 48
better 7
than 22
the 193
and 51
I 4330
am 392
sure 11
she 199
is 124
not 85
half 23
so 797
handsome 6
as 509
Jane 8
nor 102
half 23
so 797
good 28
as 509
Lydia 4
But 82
you 29
are 12
her 181
the 193
preference 3
They 5
have 11
none 32
of 109
them 9
to 805
recommend 8
them 9
he 962
they 5
are 12
all 162
and 51
like 22
other 5
but 82
has 41
something 3
more 11
of 109
than 22
her 181
Mr 5
how 27
can 287
you 29
abuse 7
your 4
own 9
in 2719
a 6799
way 27
You 29
take 18
delight 8
in 2719
me 1041
You 29
have 11
no 896
compassion 4
for 484
my 90
poor 11
You 29
mistake 5
me 1041
my 90
dear 15
I 4330
have 11
a 6799
high 54
respect 18
for 484
your 4
They 5

my 90
old 21
friends 4
I 4330
have 11
you 29

them 9
with 34
consideration 3
these 4
last 7
at 272
least 3
Ah 17
you 29
do 814
not 85
know 12
what 14
I 4330
suffer 11
But 82
I 4330
hope 16
you 29
will 39
get 13
over 596
it 67
and 51
live 43
to 805
see 70
young 9
men 140
of 109
four 26
thousand 7

the 193
It 67

us 70
if 8

come 36
since 7
you 29
will 39
not 85

Depend 17

that 11
when 6

visit 14
them 9
all 162
Mr 5
was 93
so 797
odd 17
a 6799
mixture 3
of 109
quick 25
reserve 7
and 51
caprice 3
that 11
the 193
experience 4
of 109
three 12
and 51
had 11
to 805
make 17
his 43
wife 6
understand 8
his 43
character 16
Her 181
mind 25
was 93
less 19
difficult 5
to 805
develop 12
She 199
was 93
a 6799
woman 21
of 109
mean 36
understanding 4
little 6
information 3
and 51
uncertain 5
temper 22
When 6
she 199
was 93
she 199
nervous 4
The 193
business 13
of 109
her 181

poor 11
Eliza 7
to 805

just 24
I 4330
beg 59
you 29
would 5
not 85
put 47
it 67
into 26
head 140
to 805
be 1200
by 57
his 43
ill 84
treatment 3
for 484
he 962
is 124
a 6799
disagreeable 3
man 342
that 11
it 67
would 5
be 1200
a 6799
misfortune 3
to 805
be 1200
by 57
him 9
Long 49
me 1041
last 7
night 61
that 11
he 962
sat 92
close 22
to 805
her 181
for 484
half 23
an 970
hour 10
opening 3
his 43
lips 8
Are 12
you 29
sure 11
is 124
not 85
there 21
a 6799
little 6
mistake 5
Jane 8
I 4330
saw 24
Mr 5
to 805
her 181
Aye 4
she 199
him 9
at 272
last 7
how 27
he 962
and 51
he 962
not 85
help 23
her 181
but 82
she 199
he 962
at 272
being 3
spoke 14
to 805
Miss 71
me 1041
Jane 8
that 11
he 962
never 3
his 43
intimate 5
acquaintances 3
With 34
them 9
he 962
is 124
agreeable 3
I 4330
do 814
not 85
believe 6
a 6799
word 26
of 109
it 67
my 90
dear 15
If 8
he 962
had 11
so 797
agreeable 3
he 962
would 5
have 11
to 805
Long 49
But 82
I 4330
can 287
guess 16
how 27
it 67
was 93
that 11
he 962
is 124
eat 15
up 194
with 34
pride 6
and 51
I 4330
dare 15
say 7
he 962
had 11
that 11
Long 49
does 5
not 85
keep 11
a 6799
carriage 5
and 51
had 11
come 36
to 805
the 193
ball 77
in 2719
a 6799
hack 28
chaise 3
I 4330
do 814
not 85
mind 25
his 43
not 85
to 805
Long 49
Miss 71
but 82
I 4330
wish 13
he 962
had 11
with 34
Eliza 7
time 45
her 181
mother 21
I 4330
would 5
not 85
dance 7
with 34
him 9
if 8
I 4330
were 5
you 29
I 4330
believe 6
I 4330
may 49
promise 4
you 29
never 3
to 805
dance 7
with 34
him 9
His 43
pride 6
Miss 71
does 5
not 85
offend 7
me 1041
so 797
as 509
pride 6
often 4
does 5
there 21
is 124
an 970
excuse 4
for 484
it 67
One 19
wonder 17
that 11
so 797
fine 17
a 6799
young 9
man 342
with 34
fortune 8
in 2719
his 43
should 7
think 8
of 109
If 8
I 4330
may 49
so 797
express 25
it 67
he 962
has 41
a 6799
right 31
to 805
be 1200
proud 5
That 11
is 124
true 9
Elizabeth 5
and 51
I 4330
forgive 8
his 43
pride 6
if 8
he 962
had 11
not 85
mine 26
Pride 6
Mary 13
who 79
the 193
of 109
her 181
is 124
a 6799
common 23
failing 3
I 4330
believe 6
By 57
all 162
that 11
I 4330
have 11
ever 33
read 49
I 4330
am 392
that 11
it 67
is 124
common 23
that 11
human 41
nature 3
is 124
prone 3
to 805
it 67
and 51
that 11
there 21
are 12
few 6
of 109
us 70
who 79
do 814
not 85
cherish 4
a 6799
feeling 4
of 109
self 11
on 86
the 193
score 19
of 109
some 30
or 333
other 5
real 47
or 333
and 51
pride 6
are 12
different 11
though 12
the 193
words 5
are 12
often 4
A 6799
person 33
may 49
be 1200
proud 5
being 3
vain 8
Pride 6
more 11
to 805
our 3
opinion 4
of 109
to 805
what 14
we 444
would 5
have 11
think 8
of 109
us 70
If 8
I 4330
were 5
as 509
rich 19
as 509
Mr 5
a 6799
young 9
who 79
came 36
with 34
his 43

should 7
not 85
care 47
how 27
proud 5
I 4330
was 93
I 4330
would 5
keep 11
a 6799

drink 9
a 6799
bottle 10
of 109
wine 18
a 6799
day 27
Then 5
you 29
would 5
drink 9
a 6799
great 12
deal 13
more 11
than 22
you 29

if 8
I 4330
were 5
to 805
see 70
you 29
at 272
it 67
I 4330

Jane 8
this 6
attention 3
was 93
with 34
the 193
pleasure 5
but 82
Elizabeth 5
still 13
saw 24
in 2719
treatment 3
of 109
even 36
her 181
sister 9
and 51
not 85
like 22
them 9
though 12
kindness 3
to 805
Jane 8
as 509
it 67
was 93
had 11
a 6799
value 8

that 11
he 962
did 23
admire 6
her 181

to 805
her 181
it 67
was 93
that 11
Jane 8

the 193

she 199

a 6799

it 67

him 9
and 51
it 67
will 39
then 5
be 1200
but 82
poor 11
consolation 3
to 805
believe 6
the 193
world 12
in 2719
the 193
dark 19
There 21
is 124
so 797
of 109
or 333
in 2719
every 10
attachment 3
that 11
it 67
is 124
not 85
safe 20
to 805
leave 14
any 17
to 805
We 444
can 287
all 162
begin 8
a 6799
slight 10
preference 3
is 124
natural 18
but 82
there 21
are 12
few 6
of 109
us 70
who 79
have 11
heart 57
to 805
be 1200
in 2719
love 29
encouragement 3
In 2719
nine 21
out 365
of 109
ten 151
a 6799
woman 21
had 11
better 7
show 64
more 11
affection 5
than 22
she 199
your 4
sister 9
but 82
he 962
may 49
never 3
do 814
more 11
than 22
like 22
her 181
if 8
she 199
does 5
not 85
help 23
him 9
on 86
But 82
she 199
does 5
help 23
him 9
on 86
as 509
as 509
her 181
nature 3
will 39
allow 9
If 8
I 4330
can 287
perceive 3
her 181
regard 7
for 484
him 9
he 962
must 28
be 1200
a 6799
simpleton 3
not 85
to 805
discover 10
it 67
too 50
Remember 4
Eliza 7
that 11
he 962
does 5
not 85
know 12
disposition 3
as 509
you 29
do 814
But 82
if 8
a 6799
woman 21
is 124
partial 6
to 805
a 6799
man 342
and 51
does 5
not 85
to 805
conceal 10
it 67
he 962
must 28
find 10
it 67
out 365
he 962
must 28
if 8
he 962
sees 6
of 109
her 181
But 82
though 12
and 51
Jane 8
meet 9
often 4
it 67
is 124
never 3
for 484
together 3
and 51
as 509
they 5
see 70
other 5
in 2719
large 11
it 67
is 124
that 11
every 10
moment 14
should 7
be 1200
in 2719
together 3
Jane 8
should 7
make 17
the 193
most 3
of 109
every 10
half 23
hour 10
in 2719
she 199
can 287
command 21
his 43
attention 3
When 6
she 199
is 124
secure 6
of 109
him 9
there 21
will 39
be 1200
more 11
leisure 8
for 484
in 2719
love 29
as 509
as 509
she 199
Your 4
plan 61
is 124
a 6799
good 28
one 19
Elizabeth 5
where 21
nothing 5
is 124
in 2719
question 16
but 82
the 193
desire 6
of 109
being 3
well 24
married 3
and 51
if 8
I 4330
were 5
to 805
get 13
a 6799
rich 19
husband 10
or 333
any 17
husband 10
I 4330
dare 15
say 7
I 4330
should 7
adopt 12
it 67
But 82
these 4
are 12
not 85
she 199
is 124
not 85
by 57
design 16
As 509
yet 4
she 199
even 36
be 1200
certain 5
of 109
the 193
degree 3
of 109
her 181
own 9
regard 7
nor 102
of 109
She 199
has 41
him 9
a 6799
fortnight 4
She 199
four 26
with 34
him 9
at 272
she 199
saw 24
him 9
one 19
morning 3
at 272
his 43
own 9
house 87
and 51
has 41
since 7
with 34
him 9
in 2719
four 26
times 10
This 6
is 124
not 85
to 805
make 17
her 181
understand 8
his 43
character 16
Not 85
as 509
you 29
represent 11
it 67
Had 11
she 199
with 34
him 9
she 199
might 9
have 11
he 962
had 11
a 6799
good 28
appetite 3
but 82
you 29
must 28
remember 4
that 11
four 26
have 11
also 3
together 3
and 51
four 26
may 49
do 814
a 6799
great 12
deal 13
Yes 16
these 4
four 26
have 11
them 9
to 805
ascertain 7
that 11
they 5
both 8
like 22
un 1981
better 7
than 22
but 82
with 34
respect 18
to 805
any 17
other 5
characteristic 4
I 4330
do 814
not 85
imagine 3
that 11
has 41
Well 24
Charlotte 4
I 4330
wish 13
Jane 8
success 13
with 34
all 162
my 90
heart 57
and 51
if 8
she 199
were 5
married 3
to 805
him 9
to 805
morrow 3
I 4330
should 7
think 8
she 199
had 11
as 509
good 28
a 6799
chance 20
of 109
as 509
if 8
she 199
were 5
to 805
be 1200
his 43
character 16
for 484
a 6799
twelvemonth 3
in 2719
marriage 6
is 124
a 6799
matter 7
of 109
chance 20
If 8
the 193
of 109
the 193
are 12
ever 33
so 797
well 24
to 805
other 5
or 333
ever 33
so 797
similar 5
it 67
does 5
not 85
advance 7
in 2719
the 193
least 3
They 5
continue 3
to 805
grow 21
unlike 10
to 805
have 11
share 22
of 109
vexation 3
and 51
it 67
is 124
better 7
to 805
know 12
as 509
little 6
as 509
possible 3
of 109
the 193
of 109
the 193
person 33
with 34
whom 3
you 29
are 12
to 805
pass 66
your 4
life 44
You 29
make 17
me 1041
laugh 14
Charlotte 4
but 82
it 67
is 124
not 85
sound 29
You 29
know 12
it 67
is 124
not 85
sound 29
and 51
that 11
you 29
would 5
never 3
act 69
in 2719
this 6
way 27
in 2719
Mr 5
to 805
her 181
sister 9
Elizabeth 5
was 93
far 91
that 11
she 199
was 93
an 970
object 26
of 109
some 30
interest 6
in 2719
the 193
eyes 8
of 109
his 43
friend 14
Mr 5
had 11
at 272
first 8
her 181
to 805
be 1200
pretty 3
he 962
had 11
at 272
her 181
at 272
the 193
ball 77
and 51
when 6
they 5
met 180
he 962
at 272
her 181
to 805
But 82
no 896
had 11
he 962
made 13
it 67
clear 23
to 805
and 51
his 43
friends 4
that 11
she 199
had 11
a 6799
good 28
feature 5
in 2719
her 181
face 19
than 22
he 962
to 805
find 10
it 67
was 93
intelligent 4
by 57
the 193
expression 11
of 109
her 181
dark 19
eyes 8
To 805
this 6
some 30
Though 12
he 962
had 11
with 34
a 6799
eye 57
more 11
than 22
one 19
failure 3
of 109
perfect 24
in 2719
her 181
form 68
he 962
was 93
to 805
acknowledge 3
her 181
figure 7
to 805
be 1200
light 42
and 51
pleasing 3
and 51
in 2719
spite 10
of 109
his 43
that 11
her 181
were 5
not 85
of 109
the 193
world 12
he 962
was 93
by 57
Of 109
this 6
she 199
was 93
unaware 4
to 805
her 181
he 962
was 93
the 193
man 342
who 79
made 13
agreeable 3
and 51
who 79
had 11
not 85
thought 11
her 181
handsome 6
to 805
dance 7
with 34
He 962
to 805
wish 13
to 805
know 12
more 11
of 109
her 181
and 51
as 509
a 6799
step 48
with 34
her 181
to 805
her 181
conversation 8
with 34
His 43
doing 3
so 797
her 181
notice 8
It 67
was 93
at 272
Sir 22
William 3
where 21
a 6799
large 11
party 3
were 5
What 14
does 5
Mr 5
mean 36
she 199
to 805
Charlotte 4
by 57
to 805
my 90
conversation 8
with 34
Colonel 5
That 11
is 124
a 6799
question 16
Mr 5
can 287
answer 8
But 82
if 8
he 962
does 5
it 67
any 17
more 11
I 4330
shall 12
let 50
him 9
know 12
that 11
I 4330
see 70
what 14
he 962
is 124
He 962
has 41
a 6799
eye 57
and 51
if 8
I 4330
do 814
not 85
begin 8
by 57
being 3
I 4330
shall 12
soon 3
grow 21
of 109
him 9
On 86
his 43

soon 3
though 12
to 805

it 67
she 199
to 805
him 9
and 51
Did 23
you 29
not 85
think 8
Mr 5
that 11
I 4330
well 24
just 24
now 10
when 6
I 4330
was 93
Colonel 5
to 805
give 15
us 70
a 6799
ball 77
at 272
With 34
great 12
but 82
it 67
is 124
a 6799
subject 11
makes 4
a 6799
lady 18
You 29
are 12
severe 7

us 70
It 67
will 39
be 1200

Miss 71
I 4330
am 392
going 3
to 805
open 21
the 193
instrument 16
Eliza 7
and 51
you 29
know 12
what 14
You 29
are 12
a 6799
strange 8
creature 3
by 57
way 27
of 109
a 6799
friend 14
me 1041
to 805
play 73
and 51
sing 52
and 51
If 8
my 90
had 11
a 6799
musical 9
turn 46
you 29
would 5
have 11
but 82
as 509
it 67
is 124
I 4330
would 5
not 85
sit 29
down 90
who 79
must 28
be 1200
in 2719
the 193
habit 25
of 109
hearing 3
the 193
best 37
On 86
Miss 71
she 199
well 24
if 8
it 67
must 28
be 1200
so 797
it 67
must 28
And 51
at 272
Mr 5
There 21
is 124
a 6799
fine 17
old 21
saying 3
here 31
is 124
of 109
course 10
familiar 12
with 34
your 4
breath 27
to 805
cool 22
your 4
and 51
I 4330
shall 12
keep 11
mine 26
to 805
swell 13
my 90
song 26
Her 181
performance 3
was 93
pleasing 3
though 12
by 57
no 896
capital 17
After 48
a 6799
song 26
or 333
two 14
and 51
she 199
reply 3
to 805
the 193
of 109
several 3
that 11
she 199
would 5
sing 52
she 199
was 93
at 272
the 193
instrument 16
by 57
her 181
sister 9
Mary 13
who 79
in 2719
consequence 3
of 109
being 3
the 193
plain 27
one 19
in 2719
the 193
hard 70
for 484
knowledge 4
and 51
was 93
for 484
display 6
Mary 13
had 11
genius 3
nor 102
taste 15
and 51
though 12
had 11
given 3
her 181
application 3
it 67
had 11
given 3
her 181
a 6799
air 129
and 51
conceited 4
manner 8
would 5
have 11
a 6799
degree 3
of 109
than 22
she 199
had 11
Elizabeth 5
and 51
had 11
to 805
with 34
more 11
pleasure 5
though 12
not 85
half 23
so 797
well 24
and 51
Mary 13
at 272
the 193
end 92
of 109
a 6799
long 49
concerto 3
was 93
glad 30
to 805
purchase 7
praise 7
and 51
by 57
Scotch 12
and 51
Irish 9
airs 18
at 272
the 193
request 6
of 109
her 181
who 79
with 34
some 30
of 109
the 193
and 51
two 14
or 333
three 12
in 2719
at 272
one 19
end 92
of 109
the 193
room 22
Mr 5
near 15
them 9
in 2719
silent 6
at 272
a 6799
mode 57
of 109
passing 3
the 193
evening 3
to 805
the 193
exclusion 4
of 109
all 162
conversation 8
and 51
was 93
too 50
by 57
his 43
to 805
perceive 3
that 11
Sir 22
William 3
was 93
his 43
till 14
Sir 22
William 3
What 14
a 6799
amusement 3
for 484
young 9
people 4
this 6
is 124
Mr 5
There 21
is 124
nothing 5
like 22
after 48
all 162
I 4330
consider 13
it 67
as 509
one 19
of 109
the 193
first 8
of 109
sir 22
and 51
it 67
has 41
the 193
advantage 6
also 3
of 109
being 3
in 2719
vogue 3
the 193
less 19
of 109
the 193
world 12
Every 10
savage 12
can 287
dance 7
Sir 22
William 3
Your 4
friend 14
he 962
after 48
a 6799
pause 4
on 86
join 16
the 193
group 15
and 51
I 4330
doubt 15
not 85
that 11
you 29
are 12
an 970
adept 6

My 90

I 4330
am 392
my 90
dear 15
that 11
you 29
should 7
be 1200
so 797
to 805
think 8
your 4
own 9
If 8
I 4330
to 805
think 8
of 109
it 67
should 7
not 85

If 8
my 90
are 12
I 4330
must 28
hope 16
to 805
be 1200
sensible 3
of 109
it 67
Yes 16
but 82
as 509
it 67
happens 4
they 5
are 12
all 162
of 109
them 9
clever 6
This 6
is 124
the 193
point 22
I 4330
flatter 10
on 86
we 444
do 814
not 85
agree 11
I 4330
had 11
that 11
our 3
in 2719

I 4330
must 28
so 797

differ 18
you 29

our 3
two 14
foolish 4
My 90
dear 15
Mr 5
you 29

not 85
expect 20
to 805
have 11
the 193
sense 8
of 109
father 12
and 51
mother 21
When 6
they 5
get 13
to 805
our 3
age 24
I 4330
dare 15
say 7
they 5
will 39
not 85
think 8
any 17
more 11
than 22
we 444
do 814
I 4330
remember 4
the 193
time 45
when 6
I 4330

so 797
I 4330
do 814
still 13
at 272
my 90
heart 57
and 51
if 8
a 6799
smart 20
young 9
colonel 5
with 34
five 5
or 333
six 24
thousand 7
a 6799

should 7
want 13
one 19

She 199

nothing 5
in 2719
short 62
to 805
recommend 8
her 181
but 82

keep 11
my 90

Your 4

be 1200
exact 14
but 82
this 6
was 93
all 162
me 1041
I 4330
thought 11
Miss 71
Elizabeth 5
well 24
when 6
she 199
came 36
into 26
the 193
room 22

Her 181

You 29

Mr 5
I 4330
am 392
sure 11
Miss 71
and 51
I 4330
am 392
to 805
think 8
that 11
you 29
would 5
not 85
wish 13

miles 4
or 333
it 67
is 124
above 3
her 181
in 2719
dirt 13
and 51
What 14
she 199
mean 36
by 57
it 67
It 67
to 805
me 1041
to 805
show 64
an 970
sort 14
of 109
conceited 4
a 6799
most 3
country 12
town 27
to 805
It 67
shows 5
an 970
affection 5
for 484
her 181
sister 9
that 11
is 124
pleasing 3
I 4330
am 392
Mr 5
Miss 71
in 2719
a 6799
half 23
whisper 8
that 11
this 6
adventure 11
has 41
your 4
of 109
her 181
fine 17
eyes 8
Not 85
at 272
all 162
he 962
they 5
were 5
by 57
the 193
exercise 7
A 6799
short 62
pause 4
this 6
speech 13
and 51
I 4330
have 11
an 970
regard 7
for 484
Miss 71
Jane 8
she 199
is 124
a 6799
sweet 33
girl 14
and 51
I 4330
wish 13
with 34
all 162
my 90
heart 57

were 5
well 24
But 82
with 34
a 6799
father 12
and 51
mother 21
and 51
low 46
I 4330
am 392
there 21
is 124
no 896
chance 20
of 109
it 67
I 4330
think 8
I 4330
have 11
you 29
say 7
that 11
uncle 18
is 124
an 970
attorney 3
in 2719
Yes 16
and 51
they 5
have 11
who 79
lives 4
near 15
That 11
is 124
capital 17
her 181
sister 9
and 51
they 5
both 8
If 8
they 5
had 11
to 805
fill 25
all 162
it 67
would 5
not 85
make 17
them 9
one 19
jot 10
less 19
agreeable 3
But 82
it 67
must 28
lessen 4
chance 20
of 109
men 140
of 109
any 17
consideration 3
in 2719
the 193

To 805

but 82
his 43

it 67
assent 5
and 51
mirth 8
for 484
some 30

to 805
her 181

a 6799

What 14

comprehend 4
the 193
neglect 9
of 109
a 6799

as 509
these 4
Neglect 9
I 4330
am 392
sure 11
you 29

nothing 5

There 21

With 34

of 109
Charles 5
my 90

think 8
it 67
more 11
possible 3
to 805

Miss 71

a 6799
countenance 4
And 51
so 797
for 484
her 181
age 24
Her 181
performance 3
on 86
the 193
pianoforte 3
is 124
exquisite 4
It 67
is 124
to 805
me 1041
how 27
young 9
can 287
have 11
to 805

All 162

My 90

Yes 16

They 5

tables 7

and 51
net 39
I 4330
know 12
who 79
do 814
all 162
this 6
and 51
I 4330
am 392
sure 11
I 4330
never 3
a 6799
young 9
lady 18
of 109

the 193
first 8
time 45

Your 4
list 27
of 109
the 193
common 23
extent 3
of 109
has 41
too 50
truth 7
The 193
word 26
is 124
to 805
a 6799
woman 21
who 79
it 67
no 896
than 22
by 57
a 6799
purse 7
or 333
covering 3
a 6799
screen 15
But 82
I 4330
am 392
far 91
with 34
you 29
in 2719
your 4
estimation 3
of 109
in 2719
general 22
I 4330
boast 12
of 109
knowing 3
more 11
than 22
half 23
a 6799
dozen 4
in 2719
the 193
whole 26
range 9
of 109
my 90
acquaintance 5
that 11

Nor 102
I 4330
I 4330
am 392
sure 11
Miss 71
Then 5
Elizabeth 5
you 29
must 28
comprehend 4
a 6799
great 12
deal 13
in 2719
your 4
idea 21
of 109
an 970
woman 21
Yes 16
I 4330
do 814
comprehend 4
a 6799
great 12
deal 13
in 2719
it 67
Oh 17
his 43
faithful 6
assistant 3
no 896
one 19

be 1200
who 79
does 5
not 85
surpass 4
what 14
is 124
met 180
with 34
A 6799
woman 21
must 28
have 11
a 6799
thorough 13
knowledge 4
of 109
music 24
drawing 3
and 51
the 193

to 805
deserve 4
the 193
word 26
and 51
all 162
this 6
she 199
must 28
possess 16
a 6799
certain 5
something 3
in 2719
her 181
air 129
and 51
manner 8
of 109
the 193
tone 12
of 109
her 181
voice 8
her 181
address 9
and 51
or 333
the 193
word 26
will 39
be 1200
but 82
half 23
All 162
this 6
she 199
must 28
possess 16
and 51
to 805
all 162
this 6
she 199
must 28
yet 4
add 54
something 3
more 11
in 2719
the 193
improvement 3
of 109
her 181

by 57

reading 3
I 4330
am 392

now 10
at 272

Are 12

never 3

Miss 71
both 8
out 365
the 193
injustice 3
of 109
her 181

As 509

was 93
profuse 4
in 2719
her 181
I 4330
am 392
sure 11
she 199
if 8
it 67

friends 4
I 4330

what 14
would 5
of 109
her 181
for 484
she 199

ill 84
and 51
a 6799
vast 8
deal 13

the 193

the 193

she 199
has 41
exception 6
the 193
temper 22
I 4330
have 11
ever 33
met 180
with 34
I 4330
often 4
tell 16
my 90
other 5
they 5
are 12
nothing 5
to 805
her 181
You 29
have 11
a 6799
sweet 33
room 22
here 31
Mr 5
and 51
a 6799
prospect 13
over 596
the 193
gravel 7
walk 25
I 4330
do 814
not 85
know 12
a 6799
place 29
in 2719
the 193
country 12
that 11
is 124
equal 17
to 805
You 29
will 39
not 85
think 8
of 109
it 67
in 2719
a 6799
hurry 3
I 4330
hope 16
though 12
you 29
have 11
but 82
a 6799
short 62
lease 16
I 4330
do 814
is 124
done 3
in 2719
a 6799
hurry 3
he 962
and 51
if 8
I 4330
should 7
resolve 5
to 805
quit 14
I 4330
should 7
be 1200
off 100
in 2719
five 5
At 272
present 20
I 4330
consider 13
as 509
here 31
That 11
is 124
what 14
I 4330
should 7
have 11
of 109
you 29
Elizabeth 5
You 29
begin 8
to 805
comprehend 4
me 1041
do 814
you 29
he 962
turning 3
her 181
Oh 17
yes 16
I 4330
understand 8
you 29
I 4330
wish 13
I 4330
might 9
take 18
this 6
for 484
a 6799
compliment 6
but 82
to 805
be 1200
so 797
through 4
I 4330
am 392
is 124
That 11
is 124
as 509
it 67
happens 4
It 67
does 5
not 85
follow 11
that 11
a 6799
deep 12
character 16
is 124
more 11
or 333
less 19
than 22
a 6799
one 19
as 509
yours 3
her 181
mother 21
remember 4
where 21
you 29
are 12
and 51
do 814
not 85
run 50
on 86
in 2719
the 193
wild 36
manner 8
that 11
you 29
are 12
to 805
do 814
at 272
home 90
I 4330
did 23
not 85
know 12
that 11
you 29
were 5
a 6799
of 109
character 16
It 67
must 28
be 1200
an 970
study 3
Yes 16
but 82
are 12
the 193
most 3
They 5
have 11
at 272
least 3
that 11
advantage 6
The 193
country 12
can 287
in 2719
general 22
supply 3
but 82
a 6799
few 6
for 484
a 6799
study 3
In 2719
a 6799
country 12
you 29
move 10
in 2719
a 6799
and 51
But 82
people 4
alter 27
so 797
that 11
there 21
is 124
something 3
new 115
to 805
be 1200
in 2719
them 9
for 484
ever 33
Yes 16
by 57
his 43
manner 8
of 109
a 6799
country 12
I 4330
assure 6
you 29
there 21
is 124
as 509
of 109
that 11
going 3
on 86
in 2719
the 193
country 12
as 509
in 2719
town 27
was 93
and 51
after 48
at 272
her 181
for 484
a 6799
moment 14
who 79
she 199
had 11
a 6799
complete 8
over 596
him 9
her 181
triumph 10
I 4330
see 70
that 11
London 5
has 41
any 17
great 12
advantage 6
over 596
the 193
country 12
for 484
my 90
part 102
except 10
the 193
and 51
public 18
The 193
country 12
is 124
a 6799
vast 8
deal 13
is 124
it 67
not 85
Mr 5
When 6
I 4330
am 392
in 2719
the 193
country 12
he 962
I 4330
never 3
wish 13
to 805
leave 14
it 67
and 51
when 6
I 4330
am 392
in 2719
town 27
it 67
is 124
pretty 3
the 193
same 5
They 5
have 11
and 51
I 4330
can 287
be 1200
in 2719
Aye 4
that 11
is 124
you 29
have 11
the 193
right 31
disposition 3
But 82
that 11
gentleman 3
at 272
to 805
think 8
the 193
country 12
was 93
nothing 5
at 272
all 162
Mamma 9
you 29
are 12
Elizabeth 5
for 484
her 181
mother 21
You 29
Mr 5
He 962
meant 3
that 11
there 21
was 93
not 85
a 6799
of 109
people 4
to 805
be 1200
met 180
with 34
in 2719
the 193
country 12
as 509
in 2719
the 193
town 27
you 29
must 28
acknowledge 3
to 805
be 1200
true 9
my 90
dear 15
there 21
were 5
but 82
as 509
to 805
not 85
meeting 6
with 34
people 4
in 2719
this 6
I 4330
believe 6
there 21
are 12
few 6
I 4330
know 12
we 444
dine 9
with 34
four 26
and 51
Nothing 5
but 82
concern 6
for 484
Elizabeth 5
enable 6
to 805
keep 11
his 43
countenance 4
His 43
sister 9
was 93
less 19
delicate 7
and 51
her 181
eyes 8
Mr 5
with 34
a 6799
expressive 4
smile 7
Elizabeth 5
for 484
the 193
of 109
saying 3
something 3
that 11
might 9
turn 46
her 181
now 10
her 181
if 8
Charlotte 4
had 11
at 272
since 7
her 181
coming 3
Yes 16
she 199
yesterday 3
with 34
her 181
father 12
What 14
an 970
agreeable 3
man 342
Sir 22
William 3
is 124
Mr 5
is 124
not 85
he 962
So 797
the 193
man 342
of 109
fashion 10
So 797
genteel 4
and 51
He 962
has 41
something 3
to 805
say 7
to 805
That 11
is 124
my 90
idea 21
of 109
good 28
and 51
who 79
fancy 5
and 51
never 3
open 21
mistake 5
the 193
matter 7
Did 23
Charlotte 4
dine 9
with 34
you 29
No 896
she 199
would 5
go 500
home 90
I 4330
fancy 5
she 199
was 93
the 193
mince 9
For 484
my 90
part 102
Mr 5
I 4330
keep 11
that 11
can 287
do 814
own 9
work 87
my 90
are 12
up 194
But 82
is 124
to 805
judge 6
for 484
and 51
the 193
are 12
a 6799
good 28
sort 14
of 109
I 4330
assure 6
you 29
It 67
is 124
a 6799
pity 4
they 5
are 12
not 85
handsome 6
Not 85
that 11
I 4330
think 8
Charlotte 4
so 797
plain 27
but 82
then 5
she 199
is 124
our 3
particular 13
friend 14
She 199
a 6799
pleasant 9
young 9
woman 21
Oh 17
dear 15
yes 16
but 82
you 29
must 28
own 9
she 199
is 124
plain 27
Lady 18
has 41
often 4
so 797
and 51
me 1041
I 4330
do 814
not 85
like 22
to 805
boast 12
of 109
my 90
own 9
child 28
but 82
to 805
be 1200
sure 11
Jane 8
one 19
does 5
not 85
often 4
see 70
better 7
It 67
is 124
what 14
I 4330
do 814
not 85
trust 26
my 90
own 9
When 6
she 199
was 93
fifteen 6
there 21
was 93
a 6799
man 342
at 272
my 90
brother 9
in 2719
town 27
so 797
in 2719
love 29
with 34
her 181
that 11
my 90
sister 9
in 2719
law 45
was 93
sure 11
he 962
would 5
make 17
her 181
an 970
offer 10
we 444
came 36
But 82
he 962
did 23
not 85
he 962
thought 11
her 181
too 50
young 9
he 962
some 30
on 86
her 181
and 51
pretty 3
they 5
were 5
And 51
so 797
his 43
affection 5
Elizabeth 5
There 21
has 41
a 6799
one 19
I 4330
fancy 5
in 2719
the 193
same 5
way 27
I 4330
wonder 17
who 79
first 8
the 193
of 109
in 2719
love 29
I 4330
have 11
to 805
consider 13
as 509
the 193
food 9

But 82

a 6799
slight 10
thin 35
sort 14
of 109

I 4330

the 193
general 22
pause 4
made 13
Elizabeth 5
tremble 4
lest 5
her 181
mother 21
should 7

She 199
to 805
speak 12
but 82
think 8
of 109
nothing 5
to 805
say 7
and 51
after 48
a 6799
short 62
silence 7
her 181
thanks 4

the 193
whole 26
visit 14

the 193
result 8
of 109

was 93
that 11
the 193

tax 42
Mr 5

She 199
had 11
high 54

a 6799

of 109
natural 18

address 9
Mr 5
on 86
the 193
subject 11

and 51
him 9
of 109
his 43
promise 4
that 11
it 67
would 5
be 1200
the 193
most 3
shameful 4
thing 15
in 2719
the 193
world 12
if 8
he 962
did 23
not 85
keep 11
it 67
His 43
answer 8
to 805
this 6
sudden 4
attack 8
was 93
to 805
ear 114
I 4330
am 392
I 4330
assure 6
you 29
to 805
keep 11
my 90
engagement 3

she 199
is 124
ill 84
Lydia 4
Oh 17
yes 16
it 67
would 5
be 1200
better 7
to 805
wait 19
till 14
Jane 8
was 93
well 24
and 51
by 57
that 11

most 3
Captain 8

And 51
when 6

given 3
your 4

she 199
I 4330
shall 12
insist 9
on 86
one 19
also 3
I 4330
shall 12
tell 16
Colonel 5
it 67

a 6799
shame 14
if 8

his 43

with 34
the 193
perfect 24
unconcern 4
with 34
her 181
were 5
a 6799
curious 4
dialogue 3
and 51
was 93
in 2719
union 14
with 34
her 181
opinion 4
of 109
How 27
Miss 71
will 39
be 1200
to 805
receive 8
a 6799
letter 20
He 962
made 13
no 896
answer 8
You 29
write 5
fast 29
You 29
are 12
I 4330
write 5
How 27
you 29
must 28
have 11
occasion 7
to 805
write 5
in 2719
the 193
course 10
of 109
a 6799
year 19
of 109
business 13
too 50
How 27
odious 4
I 4330
should 7
think 8
them 9
It 67
is 124
then 5
that 11
they 5
fall 29
to 805
my 90
lot 21
of 109
yours 3
Pray 9
tell 16
your 4
sister 9
that 11
I 4330
long 49
to 805
see 70
her 181
I 4330
have 11
her 181
so 797
by 57
your 4
desire 6
I 4330
am 392
you 29
do 814
not 85
like 22
your 4
pen 195
Let 50
me 1041
mend 31
it 67
for 484
you 29
I 4330
mend 31
pens 16
well 24
Thank 15
you 29
but 82
I 4330
mend 31
my 90
own 9
How 27
can 287
you 29
contrive 6
to 805
write 5
so 797
even 36
He 962
was 93
silent 6
Tell 16
your 4
sister 9
I 4330
am 392
to 805
hear 76
of 109
her 181
improvement 3
on 86
the 193
harp 27
and 51
pray 9
let 50
her 181
know 12
that 11
I 4330
am 392
in 2719
with 34
her 181
little 6
design 16
for 484
a 6799
table 27
and 51
I 4330
think 8
it 67
superior 5
to 805
Miss 71
Will 39
you 29
give 15
me 1041
leave 14
to 805
defer 14
your 4
till 14
I 4330
write 5
At 272
present 20
I 4330
have 11
not 85
room 22
to 805
do 814
them 9
justice 3
Oh 17
it 67
is 124
of 109
no 896
consequence 3
I 4330
shall 12
see 70
her 181
in 2719
But 82
do 814
you 29
write 5
long 49
to 805
her 181
Mr 5
They 5
are 12
long 49
but 82
it 67
is 124
not 85
for 484
me 1041
to 805
determine 7
It 67
is 124
a 6799
rule 7
with 34
me 1041
that 11
a 6799
person 33
who 79
can 287
write 5
a 6799
long 49
letter 20
with 34
ease 10
write 5
ill 84
That 11
will 39
not 85
do 814
for 484
a 6799
compliment 6
to 805
her 181
brother 9
he 962
does 5
not 85
write 5
with 34
ease 10
He 962
too 50
for 484
words 5
of 109
four 26
Do 814
not 85
you 29
My 90
style 4
of 109
writing 3
is 124
different 11
yours 3
Oh 17
Miss 71
Charles 5
in 2719
the 193
most 3
careless 4
way 27
He 962
out 365
half 23
his 43
words 5
and 51
the 193
rest 110
My 90
flow 27
so 797
that 11
I 4330
have 11
not 85
time 45
to 805
express 25
them 9
by 57
my 90
convey 12
no 896
at 272
all 162
to 805
my 90
Your 4
Mr 5
Elizabeth 5
must 28
disarm 7
reproof 5
Nothing 5
is 124
more 11
deceitful 4
than 22
the 193
appearance 3
of 109
It 67
is 124
often 4
of 109
opinion 4
and 51
an 970
indirect 6
boast 12
And 51
of 109
the 193
two 14
do 814
you 29
call 57
my 90
little 6
recent 6
piece 10
of 109
The 193
indirect 6
boast 12
for 484
you 29
are 12
proud 5
of 109
your 4
in 2719
writing 3
you 29
consider 13
them 9
as 509
proceeding 3
a 6799
of 109
thought 11
and 51
of 109
execution 6
if 8
not 85
you 29
think 8
at 272
least 3
The 193
power 19
of 109
doing 3
anything 3
with 34
is 124
by 57
the 193
possessor 3
and 51
often 4
any 17
attention 3
to 805
the 193
imperfection 3
of 109
the 193
performance 3
When 6
you 29
this 6
morning 3
that 11
if 8
you 29
ever 33
you 29
should 7
be 1200
gone 4
in 2719
five 5
you 29
meant 3
it 67
to 805
be 1200
a 6799
sort 14
of 109
panegyric 3
of 109
compliment 6
to 805
and 51
yet 4
what 14
is 124
there 21
so 797
in 2719
a 6799
must 28
leave 14
business 13
and 51
can 287
be 1200
of 109
no 896
real 47
advantage 6
to 805
or 333
Nay 6
this 6
is 124
too 50
to 805
remember 4
at 272
night 61
all 162
the 193
foolish 4
that 11
were 5
in 2719
the 193
morning 3
And 51
yet 4
my 90
I 4330
believe 6
what 14
I 4330
of 109
to 805
be 1200
true 9
and 51
I 4330
believe 6
it 67
at 272
this 6
moment 14
At 272
least 3
I 4330
did 23
not 85
assume 3
the 193
character 16
of 109
needless 4
to 805
show 64
off 100
the 193
I 4330
dare 15
say 7
you 29
it 67
but 82
I 4330
am 392
by 57
no 896
that 11
you 29
would 5
be 1200
gone 4
with 34
Your 4
conduct 21
would 5
be 1200
as 509
dependent 4
on 86
chance 20
as 509
that 11
of 109
any 17
man 342
I 4330
know 12
and 51
if 8
as 509
you 29
were 5
mounting 3
your 4
horse 52
a 6799
friend 14
were 5
to 805
say 7
you 29
had 11
better 7
stay 7
till 14
week 20
you 29
would 5
do 814
it 67
you 29
would 5
not 85
go 500
and 51
at 272
word 26
might 9
stay 7
a 6799
month 6
You 29
have 11
by 57
this 6
Elizabeth 5
that 11
Mr 5
did 23
not 85
do 814
justice 3
to 805
his 43
own 9
disposition 3
You 29
have 11
him 9
off 100
now 10
more 11
than 22
he 962
did 23
I 4330
am 392
by 57
your 4
what 14
my 90
friend 14
into 26
a 6799
compliment 6
on 86
the 193
of 109
my 90
temper 22
But 82
I 4330
am 392
you 29
are 12
it 67
a 6799
turn 46
that 11
gentleman 3
did 23
by 57
no 896
intend 6
for 484
he 962
would 5
think 8
better 7
of 109
me 1041
if 8
under 288
a 6799
circumstance 4
I 4330
were 5
to 805
give 15
a 6799
flat 66
denial 3
and 51
ride 9
off 100
as 509
fast 29
as 509
I 4330
Would 5
Mr 5
then 5
consider 13
the 193
of 109
your 4
original 6
as 509
for 484
by 57
your 4
in 2719
to 805
it 67
my 90
word 26
I 4330
explain 5
the 193
matter 7
must 28
speak 12
for 484
You 29
expect 20
me 1041
to 805
account 14
for 484
you 29
choose 5
to 805
call 57
mine 26
but 82
I 4330
have 11
never 3
the 193
case 25
to 805
stand 42
to 805
your 4
representation 4
you 29
must 28
remember 4
Miss 71
that 11
the 193
friend 14
who 79
is 124
to 805
desire 6
his 43
return 14
to 805
the 193
house 87
and 51

tall 35

nothing 5

Mr 5
but 82
Elizabeth 5
thought 11
she 199
perceive 3
that 11
he 962
was 93

her 181

Miss 71

in 2719
an 970
expostulation 3
with 34
her 181

for 484
I 4330
see 70
your 4

I 4330
do 814
are 12

say 7
you 29
like 22
of 109
me 1041
What 14
you 29
ask 6
Elizabeth 5
is 124
no 896
sacrifice 4
on 86
my 90
side 74
and 51
Mr 5
had 11
better 7
finish 8
his 43
letter 20
Mr 5
her 181
and 51
did 23

When 6
that 11
business 13
was 93
over 596
he 962

Miss 71
and 51
Elizabeth 5

an 970

the 193
pianoforte 3
and 51
after 48
a 6799
polite 8
request 6
that 11
Elizabeth 5
would 5
lead 15
the 193
way 27
the 193
other 5
as 509
and 51
more 11
she 199
sang 11
with 34
her 181
sister 9
and 51
while 4
they 5
were 5
Elizabeth 5
not 85

as 509
she 199
over 596
some 30
music 24
books 15
that 11
lay 42
on 86
the 193
instrument 16
how 27
Mr 5
eyes 8
were 5
on 86
her 181
She 199
how 27
to 805
suppose 4
that 11
she 199
be 1200
an 970
object 26
of 109
to 805
so 797
great 12
a 6799
man 342
and 51
yet 4
that 11
he 962
should 7
look 14
at 272
her 181
he 962
her 181
was 93
still 13
more 11
strange 8
She 199
imagine 3
at 272
last 7
that 11
she 199
his 43
notice 8
there 21
was 93
something 3
more 11
wrong 24
and 51
to 805
his 43
of 109
right 31
than 22
in 2719
any 17
other 5
person 33
present 20
The 193
supposition 3
did 23
not 85
pain 42
her 181
She 199
him 9
too 50
little 6
to 805
care 47
for 484
his 43
approbation 3
After 48
some 30
Italian 4
songs 7

soon 3
Mr 5
drawing 3
near 15
Elizabeth 5
to 805
her 181
Do 814
not 85
you 29
feel 11
a 6799
great 12
inclination 3
Miss 71
to 805
seize 3
an 970
of 109
a 6799
reel 12
She 199
but 82
made 13
no 896
answer 8
He 962
the 193
question 16
with 34
some 30
surprise 4
at 272
her 181
silence 7
Oh 17
she 199
I 4330
you 29
but 82
I 4330
not 85
determine 7
what 14
to 805
say 7
in 2719
reply 3
You 29
me 1041
I 4330
know 12
to 805
say 7
that 11
you 29
might 9
have 11
the 193
pleasure 5
of 109
my 90
taste 15
but 82
I 4330
delight 8
in 2719
kind 31
of 109
and 51
a 6799
person 33
of 109
contempt 8
I 4330
have 11
made 13
up 194
my 90
mind 25
to 805
tell 16
you 29
that 11
I 4330
do 814
not 85
want 13
to 805
dance 7
a 6799
reel 12
at 272
all 162
and 51
now 10
despise 3
me 1041
if 8
you 29
dare 15
I 4330
do 814
not 85
dare 15
Elizabeth 5
to 805
affront 5
him 9
was 93
at 272
his 43
but 82
there 21
was 93
a 6799
mixture 3
of 109
and 51
in 2719
her 181
manner 8
made 13
it 67
difficult 5
for 484
her 181
to 805
affront 5
and 51
had 11
never 3
so 797
by 57
any 17
woman 21
as 509
he 962
was 93
by 57
her 181
He 962
that 11
were 5
it 67
not 85
for 484
the 193
of 109
her 181
he 962
should 7
be 1200
in 2719
some 30
danger 7
Miss 71
saw 24
or 333
to 805
be 1200
jealous 5
and 51
her 181
great 12
for 484
the 193
of 109
her 181
dear 15
friend 14
Jane 8
some 30
her 181
desire 6
of 109
rid 42
of 109
Elizabeth 5
She 199
often 4
to 805
provoke 6
into 26
her 181
guest 9
by 57
of 109
marriage 6
and 51
his 43
in 2719
an 970
alliance 3
I 4330
hope 16
she 199
as 509
they 5
were 5
together 3
in 2719
the 193
the 193
day 27
you 29
will 39
give 15
your 4
mother 21
in 2719
law 45
a 6799
few 6
when 6
this 6
desirable 3
event 18
place 29
as 509
to 805
the 193
advantage 6
of 109
holding 3
her 181
tongue 5
and 51
if 8
you 29
can 287
compass 9
it 67
do 814
cure 9
the 193
of 109
after 48
And 51
if 8
I 4330
may 49
mention 5
so 797
delicate 7
a 6799
subject 11
to 805
check 40
that 11
little 6
something 3
on 86
conceit 7
and 51
impertinence 3
your 4
lady 18
Have 11
you 29
anything 3
to 805
propose 6
for 484
my 90
domestic 12
Oh 17
yes 16
Do 814
let 50
the 193
of 109
your 4
uncle 18
and 51
aunt 6
be 1200
in 2719
the 193
at 272
Put 47
them 9
to 805
your 4
great 12
uncle 18
the 193
judge 6
They 5
are 12
in 2719
the 193
same 5
profession 14
you 29
know 12
in 2719
different 11
lines 4
As 509
for 484
your 4
picture 8
you 29
must 28
not 85
have 11
it 67
for 484
what 14
painter 4
do 814
justice 3
to 805
eyes 8
It 67
would 5
not 85
be 1200
to 805
catch 24
expression 11
but 82
and 51
shape 13
and 51
the 193
so 797
fine 17
might 9
be 1200
At 272
that 11
moment 14
they 5
were 5
met 180
walk 25
by 57
and 51
Elizabeth 5
I 4330
did 23
not 85
know 12
that 11
you 29
intended 3
to 805
walk 25
Miss 71
in 2719
some 30
confusion 3
lest 5
they 5
had 11
You 29
us 70
ill 84
us 70
that 11
you 29
were 5
coming 3
out 365
Then 5
taking 4
the 193
arm 82
of 109
Mr 5
she 199
left 19
Elizabeth 5
to 805
walk 25
by 57
The 193
path 25
just 24
three 12
Mr 5
felt 5
and 51
This 6
walk 25
is 124
not 85
wide 15
for 484
our 3
party 3
We 444
had 11
better 7
go 500
into 26
the 193
avenue 3
But 82
Elizabeth 5
who 79
had 11
not 85
the 193
least 3
inclination 3
to 805
remain 9
with 34
them 9
No 896
no 896
stay 7
where 21
you 29
are 12
You 29
are 12
and 51
appear 7
to 805
uncommon 6
advantage 6
The 193
picturesque 4
would 5
be 1200
by 57
a 6799
fourth 4
Good 28
bye 5
She 199
then 5
ran 110
off 100
rejoicing 3
as 509
she 199
in 2719
the 193
hope 16
of 109
being 3
at 272
home 90
in 2719
a 6799
day 27
or 333
two 14
Jane 8
was 93
so 797
as 509
to 805
intend 6
leaving 3
her 181
room 22
for 484
a 6799
couple 7
of 109
that 11
evening 3
Chapter 3
When 6
the 193
after 48
dinner 9
Elizabeth 5
ran 110
up 194
to 805
her 181
sister 9
and 51
her 181
well 24
cold 9
her 181
into 26
the 193
drawing 3
room 22
where 21
she 199
was 93
by 57
her 181
two 14
friends 4
with 34
of 109
pleasure 5
and 51
Elizabeth 5
had 11
never 3
them 9
so 797
agreeable 3
as 509
they 5
were 5
the 193
hour 10
the 193
of 109
conversation 8
were 5
They 5
describe 6
an 970
entertainment 3
with 34
relate 8
an 970
anecdote 3
with 34
and 51
laugh 14
at 272
acquaintance 5
with 34
spirit 20
But 82
when 6
the 193
Jane 8
was 93
no 896
the 193
first 8
object 26
Miss 71
eyes 8
were 5
and 51
she 199
had 11
something 3
to 805
say 7
to 805
him 9
he 962
had 11
steps 7
He 962
to 805
Miss 71
with 34
a 6799
polite 8
congratulation 3
Mr 5
also 3
made 13
her 181
a 6799
slight 10
bow 58
and 51
he 962
was 93
glad 30
but 82
and 51
for 484
salutation 3
He 962
was 93
full 16
of 109
joy 36
and 51
attention 3
The 193
first 8
half 23
hour 10
was 93
in 2719
piling 3
up 194
the 193
fire 103
lest 5
she 199
should 7
suffer 11
the 193
change 21
of 109
room 22
and 51
she 199
at 272
his 43
desire 6
to 805
the 193
other 5
side 74
of 109
the 193
fireplace 3
that 11
she 199
might 9
be 1200
further 8
the 193
door 41
He 962
then 5
sat 92
down 90
by 57
her 181
and 51
to 805
Elizabeth 5
at 272
work 87
in 2719
the 193
opposite 4
corner 8
saw 24
it 67
all 162
with 34
great 12
delight 8
When 6
tea 99
was 93
over 596
Mr 5
his 43
sister 9
in 2719
law 45
of 109
the 193
card 54
table 27
but 82
in 2719
vain 8
She 199
had 11
private 9
that 11
Mr 5
did 23
not 85
wish 13
for 484
cards 7
and 51
Mr 5
soon 3
found 18
even 36
his 43
open 21
petition 8
She 199
assured 4
him 9
that 11
no 896
one 19
intended 3
to 805
play 73
and 51
the 193
silence 7
of 109
the 193
whole 26
party 3
on 86
the 193
subject 11
to 805
her 181
Mr 5
had 11
nothing 5
to 805
do 814
but 82
to 805
stretch 15
on 86
one 19
of 109
the 193
and 51
go 500
to 805
sleep 33
up 194
a 6799
book 69
Miss 71
did 23
the 193
same 5
and 51
in 2719
with 34
her 181
and 51
rings 3
now 10
and 51
then 5
in 2719
her 181
conversation 8
with 34
Miss 71
Miss 71
attention 3
was 93
as 509
in 2719
Mr 5
progress 14
through 4
his 43
book 69
as 509
in 2719
reading 3
her 181
own 9
and 51
she 199
was 93
making 4
some 30
or 333
at 272
his 43
page 15
She 199
not 85
win 229
him 9
to 805
any 17
conversation 8
he 962
her 181
question 16
and 51
read 49
on 86
At 272
length 14
by 57
the 193
attempt 5
to 805
be 1200
with 34
her 181
own 9
book 69
she 199
had 11
it 67
was 93
the 193
second 16
volume 3
of 109
his 43
she 199
gave 4
a 6799
great 12
yawn 8
and 51
How 27
pleasant 9
it 67
is 124
to 805
spend 11
an 970
evening 3
in 2719
this 6
way 27
I 4330
declare 6
after 48
all 162
there 21
is 124
no 896
enjoyment 3
like 22
reading 3
How 27
one 19
tires 7
of 109
anything 3
than 22
of 109
a 6799
book 69
When 6
I 4330
have 11
a 6799
house 87
of 109
my 90
own 9
I 4330
shall 12
be 1200
miserable 3
if 8
I 4330
have 11
not 85
an 970
No 896
one 19
made 13
any 17
reply 3
She 199
then 5
aside 3
her 181
book 69
and 51
cast 54
her 181
eyes 8
round 29
the 193
room 22
in 2719
quest 21
for 484
some 30
amusement 3
when 6
hearing 3
her 181
brother 9
a 6799
ball 77
to 805
Miss 71
she 199
him 9
and 51
By 57
the 193
bye 5
Charles 5
are 12
you 29
serious 4
in 2719
a 6799
dance 7
at 272
I 4330
would 5
advise 9
you 29
you 29
determine 7
on 86
it 67
to 805
consult 14
the 193
of 109
the 193
present 20
party 3
I 4330
am 392
if 8
there 21
are 12
not 85
some 30
us 70
to 805
whom 3
a 6799
ball 77
would 5
be 1200
a 6799
punishment 3
than 22
a 6799
pleasure 5
If 8
you 29
mean 36
her 181
brother 9
he 962
may 49
go 500
to 805
bed 93
if 8
he 962
it 67
but 82
as 509
for 484
the 193
ball 77
it 67
is 124
a 6799
thing 15
and 51
as 509
soon 3
as 509
has 41
made 13
white 55
soup 13
I 4330
shall 12
send 10
round 29
my 90
cards 7
I 4330
should 7
like 22
balls 7
better 7
she 199
if 8
they 5
were 5
on 86
in 2719
a 6799
different 11
manner 8
but 82
there 21
is 124
something 3
tedious 4
in 2719
the 193
usual 3
process 16
of 109
a 6799
meeting 6
It 67
would 5
be 1200
more 11
rational 22
if 8
conversation 8
of 109
were 5
made 13
the 193
order 11
of 109
the 193
day 27
more 11
rational 22
my 90
dear 15
I 4330
dare 15
say 7
but 82
it 67
would 5
not 85
be 1200
near 15
so 797
like 22
a 6799
ball 77
Miss 71
made 13
no 896
answer 8
and 51
soon 3
she 199
got 14
up 194
and 51
the 193
room 22
Her 181
figure 7
was 93
and 51
she 199
well 24
but 82
at 272
whom 3
it 67
was 93
all 162
was 93
still 13
studious 4
In 2719
the 193
of 109
her 181
she 199
on 86
one 19
effort 7
more 11
and 51
turning 3
to 805
Elizabeth 5
Miss 71
Eliza 7
let 50
me 1041
persuade 6
you 29
to 805
follow 11
my 90
example 4
and 51
take 18
a 6799
turn 46
the 193
room 22
I 4330
assure 6
you 29
it 67
is 124
after 48
sitting 3
so 797
long 49
in 2719
one 19
attitude 3
Elizabeth 5
was 93
but 82
to 805
it 67
Miss 71
no 896
less 19
in 2719
the 193
real 47
object 26
of 109
her 181
Mr 5
up 194
He 962
was 93
as 509
awake 8
to 805
the 193
of 109
attention 3
in 2719
that 11
quarter 25
as 509
Elizabeth 5
be 1200
and 51
his 43
book 69
He 962
was 93
to 805
join 16
party 3
but 82
he 962
it 67
that 11
he 962
imagine 3
but 82
two 14
for 484
to 805
walk 25
up 194
and 51
down 90
the 193
room 22
together 3
with 34
of 109
his 43
them 9
would 5
interfere 5
What 14
he 962
mean 36
She 199
was 93
to 805
know 12
what 14
be 1200
his 43
meaning 11
and 51
Elizabeth 5
she 199
at 272
all 162
understand 8
him 9
Not 85
at 272
all 162
was 93
her 181
answer 8
but 82
depend 17
it 67
he 962
to 805
be 1200
severe 7
on 86
us 70
and 51
our 3
way 27
of 109
him 9
will 39
be 1200
to 805
ask 6
nothing 5
it 67
Miss 71
was 93
of 109
Mr 5
in 2719
anything 3
and 51
in 2719
an 970
explanation 3
of 109
his 43
two 14
I 4330
have 11
not 85
the 193
objection 5
to 805
them 9
he 962
as 509
soon 3
as 509
she 199
him 9
to 805
speak 12
You 29
choose 5
this 6
method 18
of 109
passing 3
the 193
evening 3
you 29
are 12
in 2719
confidence 3
and 51
have 11
secret 25
to 805
discuss 10
or 333
you 29
are 12
conscious 5
that 11
your 4
appear 7
to 805
the 193
advantage 6
in 2719
if 8
the 193
first 8
I 4330
would 5
be 1200
in 2719
your 4
way 27
and 51
if 8
the 193
second 16
I 4330
can 287
admire 6
you 29
better 7
as 509
I 4330
sit 29
by 57
the 193
fire 103
Oh 17
Miss 71
I 4330
never 3
anything 3
so 797
How 27
shall 12
we 444
punish 9
him 9
for 484
a 6799
speech 13
Nothing 5
so 797
if 8
you 29
have 11
but 82
the 193
inclination 3
Elizabeth 5
We 444
can 287
all 162
plague 4
and 51
punish 9
one 19
Tease 10
him 9
laugh 14
at 272
him 9
Intimate 5
as 509
you 29
are 12
you 29
must 28
know 12
how 27
it 67
is 124
to 805
be 1200
done 3
But 82
my 90
I 4330
do 814
not 85
I 4330
do 814
assure 6
you 29
that 11
my 90
has 41
not 85
yet 4
me 1041
that 11
Tease 10
of 109
manner 8
and 51
presence 3
of 109
mind 25
No 896
no 896
I 4330
feel 11
he 962
may 49
us 70
there 21
And 51
as 509
to 805
we 444
will 39
not 85
expose 4
if 8
you 29
please 3
by 57
to 805
laugh 14
a 6799
subject 11
Mr 5
may 49
hug 20
Mr 5
is 124
not 85
to 805
be 1200
at 272
Elizabeth 5
That 11
is 124
an 970
uncommon 6
advantage 6
and 51
uncommon 6
I 4330
hope 16
it 67
will 39
continue 3
for 484
it 67
would 5
be 1200
a 6799
great 12
loss 3
to 805
me 1041
to 805
have 11
acquaintances 3
I 4330
love 29
a 6799
laugh 14
Miss 71
he 962
has 41
given 3
me 1041
more 11
credit 12
than 22
can 287
be 1200
The 193
and 51
the 193
best 37
of 109
men 140
nay 6
the 193
and 51
best 37
of 109
may 49
be 1200
ridiculous 4
by 57
a 6799
person 33
first 8
object 26
in 2719
life 44
is 124
a 6799
joke 8
Elizabeth 5
there 21
are 12
people 4
but 82
I 4330
hope 16
I 4330
am 392
not 85
one 19
of 109
them 9
I 4330
hope 16
I 4330
never 3
ridicule 4
what 14
is 124
wise 17
and 51
good 28
and 51
whims 8
and 51
do 814
divert 6
me 1041
I 4330
own 9
and 51
I 4330
laugh 14
at 272
them 9
I 4330
can 287
But 82
these 4
I 4330
suppose 4
are 12
what 14
you 29
are 12
that 11
is 124
not 85
possible 3
for 484
But 82
it 67
has 41
the 193
study 3
of 109
my 90
life 44
to 805
avoid 8
often 4
expose 4
a 6799
strong 16
understanding 4
to 805
ridicule 4
as 509
and 51
pride 6
Yes 16
is 124
a 6799
weakness 3
But 82
pride 6
where 21
there 21
is 124
a 6799
real 47
of 109
mind 25
pride 6
will 39
be 1200
under 288
good 28
regulation 3
Elizabeth 5
to 805
hide 18
a 6799
smile 7
Your 4
examination 3
of 109
Mr 5
is 124
over 596
I 4330
presume 3
Miss 71
and 51
pray 9
what 14
is 124
the 193
result 8
I 4330
am 392
by 57
it 67
that 11
Mr 5
has 41
no 896
defect 17
He 962
it 67
disguise 4
No 896
I 4330
have 11
made 13
no 896
pretension 3
I 4330
have 11
but 82
they 5
are 12
not 85
I 4330
hope 16
of 109
understanding 4
My 90
temper 22
I 4330
dare 15
not 85
vouch 11
for 484
It 67
is 124
I 4330
believe 6
too 50
little 6
too 50
little 6
for 484
the 193
convenience 3
of 109
the 193
world 12
I 4330
forget 8
the 193
and 51
of 109
so 797
soon 3
as 509
I 4330
nor 102
My 90
are 12
not 85
with 34
every 10
attempt 5
to 805
move 10
them 9
My 90
temper 22
would 5
be 1200
resentful 4
My 90
good 28
opinion 4
is 124
forever 3
That 11
is 124
a 6799
failing 3
Elizabeth 5
resentment 3
is 124
a 6799
shade 4
in 2719
a 6799
character 16
But 82
you 29
have 11
your 4
fault 20
well 24
I 4330
laugh 14
at 272
it 67
You 29
are 12
safe 20
me 1041
There 21
is 124
I 4330
believe 6
in 2719
every 10
disposition 3
a 6799
to 805
some 30
particular 13
evil 15
a 6799
natural 18
defect 17
not 85
even 36
the 193
best 37
education 9
can 287
And 51
your 4
defect 17
is 124
to 805
hate 14
And 51
yours 3
he 962
with 34
a 6799
smile 7
is 124
to 805
misunderstand 5
them 9
Do 814
let 50
us 70
have 11
a 6799
little 6
music 24
Miss 71
tired 6
of 109
a 6799
conversation 8
in 2719
she 199
had 11
no 896
share 22
you 29
will 39
not 85

my 90
Mr 5
Her 181
sister 9
had 11
not 85
the 193
objection 5
and 51
the 193
pianoforte 3
was 93
and 51
after 48
a 6799
few 6
recollection 3
was 93
not 85
for 484
it 67
He 962
to 805
feel 11
the 193
danger 7
of 109
Elizabeth 5

attention 3
Chapter 3
In 2719
consequence 3
of 109
an 970
agreement 3
the 193
Elizabeth 5
the 193
morning 3
to 805
mother 21

beg 59
that 11
the 193

for 484
them 9
in 2719
the 193
course 10
of 109

But 82
who 79
had 11
on 86
her 181
at 272
till 14
the 193
following 3
Tuesday 3
would 5
finish 8
week 20
not 85
bring 6

receive 8
them 9
with 34
pleasure 5
Her 181
answer 8
was 93
not 85
at 272

not 85

This 6
a 6799
general 22

it 67

attention 3
It 67
is 124

not 85
talk 18
of 109
that 11
odious 4
man 342
I 4330
do 814
think 8
it 67
is 124
the 193
thing 15
in 2719
the 193
world 12
that 11
your 4
estate 3
should 7
be 1200
your 4
own 9
and 51
I 4330
am 392
sure 11

you 29
I 4330
should 7
have 11
long 49
ago 15
to 805
do 814
something 3
or 333
other 5
it 67
Jane 8
and 51
Elizabeth 5
to 805
explain 5
to 805
her 181
the 193
nature 3
of 109
an 970
entail 6
They 5
had 11
often 4
to 805
do 814
it 67
but 82
it 67
was 93
a 6799
subject 11
on 86
was 93
the 193
reach 6
of 109
reason 13
and 51
she 199
to 805
rail 26
the 193
of 109
an 970
estate 3
a 6799
of 109
five 5
in 2719
of 109
a 6799
man 342
whom 3
anything 3
It 67
is 124
a 6799
most 3
affair 3
Mr 5
and 51
nothing 5
can 287
clear 23
Mr 5
the 193
guilt 9
of 109
But 82
if 8
you 29
will 39
listen 9
to 805
his 43
letter 20
you 29
may 49
be 1200
a 6799

sure 11
I 4330

him 9
to 805
write 5
to 805
you 29
at 272
all 162
and 51
I 4330
hate 14
false 12
friends 4
Why 4

keep 11
on 86
with 34
you 29
as 509
his 43

WILLIAM 3
At 272
four 26
we 444
may 49
expect 20
this 6
peace 21
making 4
gentleman 3
Mr 5
as 509
he 962
up 194
the 193
letter 20
He 962
to 805
be 1200
a 6799
most 3
conscientious 4
and 51
polite 8
young 9
man 342
my 90
word 26
and 51
I 4330
doubt 15
not 85
will 39
prove 21
a 6799
valuable 3
acquaintance 5
if 8
Lady 18
should 7
be 1200
so 797
as 509
to 805
let 50
him 9
come 36
to 805
us 70
There 21
is 124
some 30
sense 8
in 2719
what 14
he 962
the 193
and 51
if 8
he 962
is 124
to 805
make 17
them 9
any 17
I 4330
shall 12
not 85
be 1200
the 193
person 33
to 805
discourage 6
him 9
Though 12
it 67
is 124
difficult 5
Jane 8
to 805
guess 16
in 2719
what 14
way 27
he 962
can 287
mean 36
to 805
make 17
us 70
the 193
he 962
our 3
due 21
the 193
wish 13
is 124
to 805
his 43
credit 12
Elizabeth 5
was 93
by 57
his 43
for 484
Lady 18
and 51
his 43
kind 31
intention 5
of 109
christening 3
and 51
his 43
it 67
were 5
He 962
must 28
be 1200
an 970
I 4330
think 8
she 199
I 4330
make 17
him 9
out 365
There 21
is 124
something 3
pompous 4
in 2719
his 43
style 4
And 51
what 14
can 287
he 962
mean 36
by 57
for 484
being 3
in 2719
the 193
entail 6
We 444
suppose 4
he 962
would 5
help 23
it 67
if 8
he 962
he 962
be 1200
a 6799
sensible 3
man 342
sir 22
No 896
my 90
dear 15
I 4330
think 8
not 85
I 4330
have 11
great 12
of 109
finding 4
him 9
the 193
reverse 5
There 21
is 124
a 6799
mixture 3
of 109

self 11
in 2719
his 43
letter 20
well 24
I 4330
am 392
to 805
see 70
him 9
In 2719
point 22
of 109
composition 3
Mary 13
the 193
letter 20
does 5
not 85
seem 10
defective 6
The 193
idea 21
of 109
the 193
olive 6
branch 6
is 124
not 85
new 115
yet 4
I 4330
think 8
it 67
is 124
well 24
To 805
and 51
Lydia 4
the 193
letter 20
nor 102
writer 3
were 5
in 2719
any 17
degree 3
It 67
was 93
to 805
that 11
cousin 3
should 7
come 36
in 2719
a 6799
coat 12
and 51
it 67
was 93
now 10
some 30
since 7
they 5
had 11
pleasure 5
the 193
of 109
a 6799
man 342
in 2719
any 17
other 5
As 509
for 484
mother 21
Mr 5
letter 20
had 11
done 3
of 109
her 181
ill 84
will 39
and 51
she 199
was 93
to 805
see 70
him 9
with 34
a 6799
degree 3
of 109
her 181
husband 10
and 51
Mr 5
was 93
punctual 4
to 805
his 43
time 45
and 51
was 93
with 34
great 12
by 57
the 193
whole 26
Mr 5
little 6
but 82
the 193
were 5
to 805
talk 18
and 51
Mr 5
in 2719
need 29
of 109
encouragement 3
nor 102
to 805
be 1200
silent 6
He 962
was 93
a 6799
tall 35
heavy 7
young 9
man 342
of 109
five 5
and 51
His 43
air 129
was 93
grave 28
and 51
and 51
his 43
were 5
formal 21
He 962
had 11
not 85
long 49
he 962
on 86
so 797
fine 17
a 6799
of 109
he 962
had 11
of 109
but 82
that 11
in 2719
this 6
instance 4
fame 3
had 11
short 62
of 109
the 193
truth 7
and 51
that 11
he 962
did 23
not 85
doubt 15
her 181
them 9
all 162
in 2719
due 21
time 45
of 109
in 2719
marriage 6
This 6
was 93
not 85
to 805
the 193
taste 15
of 109
some 30
of 109
his 43
but 82

with 34
no 896
most 3
You 29
are 12
kind 31
I 4330
am 392
sure 11
and 51
I 4330
wish 13
with 34
all 162
my 90
heart 57
it 67
may 49
prove 21
so 797
for 484
they 5
will 39
be 1200
are 12
so 797
You 29
allude 3
to 805
the 193
entail 6
of 109
this 6
estate 3
Ah 17
sir 22
I 4330
do 814
It 67
is 124
a 6799
grievous 4
affair 3
to 805
my 90
poor 11
you 29
must 28
confess 14
Not 85
that 11
I 4330
mean 36
to 805
find 10
fault 20
with 34
you 29
for 484
I 4330
know 12
are 12
all 162
chance 20
in 2719
this 6
world 12
There 21
is 124
no 896
knowing 3
how 27
will 39
go 500
when 6
they 5
come 36
to 805
be 1200
I 4330
am 392
sensible 3
madam 5
of 109
the 193
hardship 3
to 805
my 90
fair 25
and 51
say 7
on 86
the 193
subject 11
but 82
that 11
I 4330
am 392
cautious 4
of 109
forward 12
and 51
precipitate 5
But 82
I 4330
can 287
assure 6
the 193
young 9
that 11
I 4330
come 36
prepared 3
to 805
admire 6
them 9
At 272
present 20
I 4330
will 39
not 85
say 7
more 11
but 82
when 6
we 444

his 43
commendation 3
of 109
would 5
have 11
heart 57
but 82
for 484
the 193
supposition 3
of 109
his 43
viewing 3
it 67
all 162
as 509
his 43

future 3
The 193

But 82

able 3

or 333
I 4330
am 392
not 85
to 805
form 68
one 19
I 4330
have 11
him 9
too 50
long 49
and 51
too 50
well 24
to 805
be 1200
a 6799
fair 25
judge 6
It 67
is 124
for 484
me 1041
to 805
be 1200
impartial 4
But 82
I 4330
believe 6
your 4
opinion 4
of 109
him 9
would 5
in 2719
general 22
astonish 7
and 51
you 29
would 5
not 85
express 25
it 67
so 797
Here 31
you 29
are 12
in 2719
your 4
own 9
my 90
word 26
I 4330
say 7
no 896
more 11
here 31
than 22
I 4330
might 9
say 7
in 2719
any 17
house 87
in 2719
the 193
except 10
He 962
is 124
not 85
at 272
all 162
in 2719
is 124
with 34
his 43
pride 6
You 29
will 39
not 85
find 10
him 9
more 11
of 109
by 57
I 4330
pretend 7
to 805
be 1200
after 48
a 6799
short 62
interruption 3
that 11
he 962
or 333
that 11
any 17
man 342
should 7
not 85
be 1200
but 82
with 34
him 9
I 4330
believe 6
it 67
does 5
not 85
often 4
happen 9
The 193
world 12
is 124
by 57
his 43
fortune 8
and 51
consequence 3
or 333
by 57
his 43
high 54
and 51
and 51
sees 6
him 9
as 509
he 962
to 805
be 1200
I 4330
should 7
take 18
him 9
even 36
on 86
my 90
slight 10
acquaintance 5
to 805
be 1200
an 970
ill 84
man 342
his 43
head 140
I 4330
wonder 17
he 962
at 272
the 193
of 109
he 962
is 124
to 805
be 1200
in 2719
this 6
country 12
I 4330
do 814
not 85
at 272
all 162
know 12
but 82
I 4330
nothing 5
of 109
his 43
going 3
when 6
I 4330
was 93
at 272
I 4330
hope 16
your 4
in 2719
of 109
the 193
shire 3
will 39
not 85
be 1200
by 57
his 43
being 3
in 2719
the 193
Oh 17
no 896
it 67
is 124
not 85
for 484
me 1041
to 805
be 1200
by 57
Mr 5
If 8
he 962
to 805
avoid 8
me 1041
he 962
must 28
go 500
We 444
are 12
not 85
on 86
and 51
it 67
me 1041
pain 42
to 805
meet 9
him 9
but 82
I 4330
have 11
no 896
reason 13
for 484
him 9
but 82
what 14
I 4330
might 9
proclaim 4
all 162
the 193
world 12
a 6799
sense 8
of 109
great 12
ill 84
usage 3
and 51
most 3
painful 6
at 272
his 43
being 3
what 14
he 962
is 124
His 43
father 12
Miss 71
the 193
late 23
Mr 5
was 93
one 19
of 109
the 193
best 37
men 140
that 11
ever 33
and 51
the 193
friend 14
I 4330
ever 33
had 11
and 51
I 4330
can 287
never 3
be 1200
in 2719
with 34
this 6
Mr 5
being 3
to 805
the 193
soul 10
by 57
a 6799
thousand 7
tender 27
His 43
to 805
has 41
but 82
I 4330
believe 6
I 4330
forgive 8
him 9
anything 3
and 51
than 22
his 43
the 193
and 51
the 193
of 109
his 43
father 12
Elizabeth 5
found 18
the 193
interest 6
of 109
the 193
subject 11
increase 4
and 51
with 34
all 162
her 181
heart 57
but 82
the 193
of 109
it 67
further 8
Mr 5
to 805
speak 12
on 86
more 11
general 22
the 193
the 193
with 34
all 162
that 11
he 962
had 11
yet 4
and 51
of 109
the 193
latter 3
with 34
gentle 18
but 82
It 67
was 93
the 193
prospect 13
of 109
constant 7
and 51
good 28
he 962
was 93
my 90
chief 14
inducement 3
to 805
enter 23
the 193
shire 3
I 4330
it 67
to 805
be 1200
a 6799
most 3
agreeable 3
corps 8
and 51
my 90
friend 14
me 1041
further 8
by 57
his 43
account 14
of 109
present 20
quarters 4
and 51
the 193
great 12
and 51
acquaintances 3
had 11
them 9
I 4330
own 9
is 124
to 805
me 1041
I 4330
have 11
a 6799
man 342
and 51
my 90
will 39
not 85
bear 30
I 4330
must 28
have 11
employment 3
and 51
A 6799
life 44
is 124
not 85
what 14
I 4330
was 93
intended 3
for 484
but 82
have 11
now 10
made 13
it 67
The 193
church 21
to 805
have 11
my 90
profession 14
I 4330
was 93
up 194
for 484
the 193
church 21
and 51
I 4330
should 7
at 272
this 6
time 45
have 11
in 2719
possession 3
of 109
a 6799
most 3
valuable 3
living 5
had 11
it 67
the 193
gentleman 3
we 444
were 5
of 109
just 24
now 10
Yes 16
the 193
late 23
Mr 5
me 1041
the 193
presentation 3
of 109
the 193
best 37
living 5
in 2719
his 43
gift 5
He 962
was 93
my 90
godfather 3
and 51
to 805
me 1041
I 4330
do 814
justice 3
to 805
his 43
kindness 3
He 962
meant 3
to 805
provide 13
for 484
me 1041
and 51
thought 11
he 962
had 11
done 3
it 67
but 82
when 6
the 193
living 5
fell 22
it 67
was 93
given 3
Good 28
Elizabeth 5
but 82
how 27
that 11
be 1200
How 27
his 43
will 39
be 1200
Why 4
did 23
you 29
not 85
seek 6
legal 21
redress 5
There 21
was 93
just 24
an 970
in 2719
the 193
of 109
the 193
bequest 3
as 509
to 805
give 15
me 1041
no 896
hope 16
law 45
A 6799
man 342
of 109
not 85
have 11
the 193
intention 5
but 82
Mr 5
to 805
doubt 15
it 67
or 333
to 805
treat 15
it 67
as 509
a 6799
conditional 4
recommendation 3
and 51
to 805
assert 11
that 11
I 4330
had 11
all 162
claim 12
to 805
it 67
by 57
extravagance 3
in 2719
short 62
anything 3
or 333
nothing 5
Certain 5
it 67
is 124
that 11
the 193
living 5
two 14
ago 15
as 509
I 4330
was 93
of 109
an 970
age 24
to 805
hold 22
it 67
and 51
that 11
it 67
was 93
given 3
to 805
man 342
and 51
no 896
less 19
certain 5
is 124
it 67
that 11
I 4330
accuse 6
of 109
done 3
anything 3
to 805
deserve 4
to 805
lose 5
it 67
I 4330
have 11
a 6799
warm 23
temper 22
and 51
I 4330
may 49
have 11
my 90
opinion 4
of 109
him 9
and 51
to 805
him 9
too 50
I 4330
can 287
recall 5
nothing 5
worse 6
But 82
the 193
fact 35
is 124
that 11
we 444
are 12
different 11
sort 14
of 109
men 140
and 51
that 11
he 962
me 1041
This 6
is 124
He 962
to 805
be 1200
Some 30
time 45
or 333
other 5
he 962
will 39
be 1200
but 82
it 67
shall 12
not 85
be 1200
by 57
me 1041
Till 14
I 4330
can 287
forget 8
his 43
father 12
I 4330
can 287
never 3
or 333
expose 4
him 9
Elizabeth 5
him 9
for 484
and 51
thought 11
him 9
than 22
ever 33
as 509
he 962
them 9
But 82
what 14
she 199
after 48
a 6799
pause 4
can 287
have 11
his 43
motive 4
What 14
can 287
have 11
him 9
to 805
behave 3
so 797
A 6799
thorough 13
dislike 4
of 109
me 1041
a 6799
dislike 4
I 4330
but 82
attribute 4
in 2719
some 30
measure 8
to 805
Had 11
the 193
late 23
Mr 5
me 1041
less 19
his 43
son 70
might 9
have 11
borne 3
with 34
me 1041
better 7
but 82
his 43
uncommon 6
attachment 3
to 805
me 1041
him 9
I 4330
believe 6
in 2719
life 44
He 962
had 11
not 85
a 6799
temper 22
to 805
bear 30
the 193
sort 14
of 109
competition 3
in 2719
we 444
the 193
sort 14
of 109
preference 3
was 93
often 4
given 3
me 1041
I 4330
had 11
not 85
thought 11
Mr 5
so 797
bad 33
as 509
this 6
though 12
I 4330
have 11
never 3
him 9
I 4330
had 11
not 85
thought 11
so 797
ill 84
of 109
him 9
I 4330
had 11
him 9
to 805
be 1200
his 43
fellow 9
in 2719
general 22
but 82
did 23
not 85
suspect 5
him 9
of 109
to 805
malicious 4
revenge 6
injustice 3
as 509
this 6
After 48
a 6799
few 6
reflection 3
she 199
I 4330
do 814
remember 4
his 43
one 19
day 27
at 272
of 109
the 193
of 109
his 43
of 109
his 43
an 970
temper 22
His 43
disposition 3
must 28
be 1200
dreadful 4
I 4330
will 39
not 85
trust 26
on 86
the 193
subject 11
I 4330
can 287
be 1200
just 24
to 805
him 9
Elizabeth 5
was 93
deep 12
in 2719
thought 11
and 51
after 48
a 6799
time 45
To 805
treat 15
in 2719
a 6799
manner 8
the 193
godson 3
the 193
friend 14
the 193
of 109
his 43
father 12
She 199
have 11
A 6799
young 9
man 342
too 50
like 22
you 29
countenance 4
may 49
vouch 11
for 484
your 4
being 3
but 82
she 199
contented 4
with 34
and 51
one 19
too 50
who 79
had 11
his 43
companion 10
childhood 3
together 3
as 509
I 4330
think 8
you 29
in 2719
the 193
manner 8
We 444
were 5
born 4
in 2719
the 193
same 5
parish 6
within 3
the 193
same 5
park 18
the 193
part 102
of 109
our 3
youth 7
was 93
together 3
of 109
the 193
same 5
house 87
the 193
same 5
of 109
the 193
same 5
care 47
My 90
father 12
life 44
in 2719
the 193
profession 14
your 4
uncle 18
Mr 5
to 805
do 814
so 797
credit 12
to 805
but 82
he 962
gave 4
up 194
to 805
be 1200
of 109
use 18
to 805
the 193
late 23
Mr 5
and 51
all 162
his 43
time 45
to 805
the 193
care 47
of 109
the 193
He 962
was 93
most 3
by 57
Mr 5
a 6799
most 3
intimate 5
confidential 4
friend 14
Mr 5
often 4
to 805
be 1200
under 288
the 193
to 805
my 90
active 6
and 51
when 6
my 90
death 19
Mr 5
gave 4
him 9
a 6799
promise 4
of 109
for 484
me 1041
I 4330
am 392
that 11
he 962
felt 5
it 67
to 805
be 1200
as 509
a 6799
debt 6
of 109
to 805
him 9
as 509
of 109
his 43
affection 5
to 805
How 27
strange 8
Elizabeth 5
How 27
I 4330
wonder 17
that 11
the 193
pride 6
of 109
this 6
Mr 5
has 41
not 85
made 13
him 9
just 24
to 805
you 29
If 8
no 896
better 7
motive 4
that 11
he 962
should 7
not 85
have 11
too 50
proud 5
to 805
be 1200
dishonest 4
for 484
I 4330
must 28
call 57
it 67
It 67
is 124
wonderful 4
for 484
all 162
his 43
may 49
be 1200
to 805
pride 6
and 51
pride 6
had 11
often 4
his 43
best 37
friend 14
It 67
has 41
him 9
with 34
virtue 3
than 22
with 34
any 17
other 5
feeling 4
But 82
we 444
are 12
none 32
of 109
us 70
and 51
in 2719
his 43
to 805
me 1041
there 21
were 5
even 36
than 22
pride 6
Can 287
pride 6
as 509
his 43
have 11
ever 33
done 3
him 9
good 28
Yes 16
It 67
has 41
often 4
led 11
him 9
to 805
be 1200
liberal 17

I 4330
nothing 5
at 272
all 162
of 109
Lady 18
I 4330
never 3
of 109
her 181

till 14
the 193

yesterday 3
Her 181
daughter 4
Miss 71
de 2452
will 39
have 11
a 6799
large 11
fortune 8

it 67
is 124
that 11

unite 4
the 193

This 6
information 3
made 13
Elizabeth 5
smile 7
as 509
she 199
thought 11
of 109
poor 11
Miss 71
Vain 8
must 28
be 1200
all 162
her 181
vain 8
and 51
useless 4
her 181
affection 5
for 484
his 43
sister 9
and 51
her 181
praise 7
of 109
if 8
he 962
were 5
self 11
for 484
Mr 5
she 199
both 8
of 109
Lady 18
and 51
her 181
daughter 4
but 82
some 30
that 11
he 962
has 41
related 3
of 109
her 181
ladyship 3
I 4330
suspect 5
his 43
him 9
and 51
that 11
in 2719
spite 10
of 109
her 181
being 3
his 43
patroness 3
she 199
is 124
an 970
conceited 4
woman 21
I 4330
believe 6
her 181
to 805
be 1200
both 8
in 2719
a 6799
great 12
degree 3
I 4330
have 11
not 85
her 181
for 484
but 82
I 4330
well 24
remember 4
that 11
I 4330
never 3
her 181
and 51
that 11
her 181
were 5
and 51
She 199
has 41
the 193
reputation 3
of 109
being 3
sensible 3
and 51
clever 6
but 82
I 4330
believe 6
she 199
part 102
of 109
her 181
her 181
rank 19
and 51
fortune 8
part 102
her 181
authoritative 4
manner 8
and 51
the 193
rest 110
the 193
pride 6
for 484
her 181
nephew 3
who 79
that 11
with 34
him 9
should 7
have 11
an 970
understanding 4
of 109
the 193
first 8
class 44
Elizabeth 5
that 11
he 962
had 11
given 3
a 6799
rational 22
account 14
of 109
it 67
and 51
they 5
together 3
with 34
mutual 4
satisfaction 3
till 14
supper 4
put 47
an 970
end 92
to 805
cards 7

gave 4
the 193

the 193

Elizabeth 5
with 34
her 181

full 16
of 109
him 9
She 199
think 8
of 109
nothing 5
but 82
of 109
Mr 5
and 51
of 109
what 14
he 962
had 11
her 181
all 162

Elizabeth 5

Jane 8
the 193

what 14
had 11
Mr 5
and 51
Jane 8
with 34
and 51
concern 6
she 199
not 85
how 27
to 805
believe 6
that 11
Mr 5
be 1200
so 797
of 109
Mr 5
regard 7
and 51
yet 4
it 67
was 93
not 85
in 2719
her 181
nature 3
to 805
question 16
the 193
of 109
a 6799
young 9
man 342
of 109
appearance 3
as 509
The 193
of 109
his 43
was 93
to 805
interest 6
all 162
her 181
tender 27
and 51
nothing 5
to 805
be 1200
done 3
but 82
to 805
think 8
well 24
of 109
them 9
both 8
to 805
defend 10
the 193
conduct 21
of 109
and 51
throw 14
into 26
the 193
account 14
of 109
accident 7
or 333
mistake 5
not 85
be 1200
They 5
have 11
both 8
she 199
I 4330
dare 15
say 7
in 2719
some 30
way 27
or 333
other 5
of 109
we 444
can 287
form 68
no 896
idea 21
people 4
have 11
to 805
the 193
other 5
It 67
is 124
in 2719
short 62
for 484
us 70
to 805
conjecture 4
the 193
or 333
may 49
have 11
them 9
actual 11
blame 12
on 86
side 74
true 9
and 51
now 10
my 90
dear 15
Jane 8
what 14
have 11
you 29
got 14
to 805
say 7
on 86
of 109
the 193
people 4
who 79
have 11
in 2719
the 193
business 13
Do 814
clear 23
them 9
too 50
or 333
we 444
shall 12
be 1200
to 805
think 8
ill 84
of 109
Laugh 14
as 509
as 509
you 29
choose 5
but 82
you 29
will 39
not 85
laugh 14
me 1041
out 365
of 109
my 90
opinion 4
My 90
do 814
but 82
consider 13
in 2719
what 14
a 6799
disgraceful 4
light 42
it 67
Mr 5
to 805
be 1200
his 43
in 2719
a 6799
manner 8
one 19
whom 3
his 43
father 12
had 11
to 805
provide 13
for 484
It 67
is 124
No 896
man 342
of 109
common 23
no 896
man 342
who 79
had 11
any 17
value 8
for 484
his 43
character 16
be 1200
of 109
it 67
Can 287
his 43
most 3
intimate 5
friends 4
be 1200
so 797
in 2719
him 9
Oh 17
no 896
I 4330
can 287
more 11
believe 6
Mr 5
being 3
on 86
than 22
that 11
Mr 5
should 7
invent 19
a 6799
of 109
as 509
he 962
gave 4
me 1041
last 7
night 61
names 4
If 8
it 67
be 1200
not 85
so 797
let 50
Mr 5
contradict 8
it 67
there 21
was 93
truth 7
in 2719
his 43
It 67
is 124
difficult 5
it 67
is 124
One 19
does 5
not 85
know 12
what 14
to 805
think 8
I 4330
beg 59
your 4
pardon 10
one 19
what 14
to 805
think 8
But 82
Jane 8
think 8
with 34
on 86
one 19
point 22
that 11
Mr 5
if 8
he 962
had 11
on 86
would 5
have 11
to 805
suffer 11
when 6
the 193
affair 3
public 18
The 193
two 14
young 9
were 5
the 193
where 21
this 6
conversation 8
by 57
the 193
arrival 3
of 109
the 193

whom 3
they 5
had 11
Mr 5
and 51
his 43
came 36
to 805
give 15
personal 13
invitation 6
for 484
the 193
long 49
ball 77
at 272
was 93
for 484
the 193
following 3
Tuesday 3
The 193
two 14
were 5
to 805
see 70
dear 15
friend 14
it 67
an 970
age 24
since 7
they 5
had 11

The 193

not 85
choose 5
to 805

the 193
hint 13
being 3
well 24
aware 3
that 11
a 6799
serious 4
dispute 7
must 28
be 1200
the 193
consequence 3
of 109

a 6799
doubt 15
of 109
his 43

The 193

any 17
of 109

She 199

prepared 3
in 2719
the 193

the 193
conquest 3
of 109
all 162
that 11

won 33
in 2719

But 82
in 2719
an 970

though 12
this 6
was 93
not 85
the 193
case 25
the 193
absolute 7
fact 35
of 109
his 43

his 43

assured 4
her 181
that 11
was 93
not 85
less 19

her 181
first 8
surmise 4

just 24
every 10
feeling 4

But 82
Elizabeth 5

though 12
every 10
prospect 13

soon 3
able 3
to 805

a 6799
transition 7
to 805
the 193
of 109
her 181

solemn 21
of 109

often 4
wrong 24
being 3
aware 3
of 109
it 67
gave 4
her 181
all 162
the 193
shame 14
and 51
a 6799
disagreeable 3
partner 8
for 484
a 6799
couple 7
of 109
can 287
give 15
The 193
moment 14
of 109
her 181
release 4

was 93
She 199
with 34
an 970

To 805

break 43
it 67
till 14
that 11
it 67
would 5
be 1200
the 193
punishment 3
to 805
her 181
partner 8
to 805
oblige 3
him 9
to 805
talk 18
she 199
made 13
some 30
slight 10
observation 4
on 86
the 193
dance 7
He 962
and 51
was 93
silent 6
After 48
a 6799
pause 4
of 109
some 30
she 199
him 9
a 6799
second 16
time 45
with 34
It 67
is 124
your 4
turn 46
to 805
say 7
something 3
now 10
Mr 5
I 4330
the 193
dance 7
and 51
you 29
to 805
make 17
some 30
sort 14
of 109
remark 9
on 86
the 193
size 5
of 109
the 193
room 22
or 333
the 193
number 8
of 109
He 962
and 51
assured 4
her 181
that 11
she 199
him 9
to 805
say 7
should 7
be 1200
well 24
That 11
reply 3
will 39
do 814
for 484
the 193
present 20
by 57
and 51
by 57
I 4330
may 49
observe 6
that 11
private 9
balls 7
are 12
than 22
public 18
But 82
now 10
we 444
may 49
be 1200
silent 6
Do 814
you 29
talk 18
by 57
rule 7
then 5
while 4
you 29
are 12
One 19
must 28
speak 12
a 6799
little 6
you 29
know 12
It 67
would 5
look 14
odd 17
to 805
be 1200
silent 6
for 484
half 23
an 970
hour 10
together 3
and 51
yet 4
for 484
the 193
advantage 6
of 109
some 30
conversation 8
to 805
be 1200
so 797
as 509
that 11
they 5
may 49
have 11
the 193
trouble 18
of 109
saying 3
as 509
little 6
as 509
possible 3
Are 12
you 29
your 4
own 9
in 2719
the 193
present 20
case 25
or 333
do 814
you 29
imagine 3
that 11
you 29
are 12
mine 26
Both 8
Elizabeth 5
for 484
I 4330
have 11
a 6799
great 12
in 2719
the 193
turn 46
of 109
our 3
minds 4
We 444
are 12
of 109
an 970
taciturn 4
disposition 3
unwilling 4
to 805
speak 12
we 444
expect 20
to 805
say 7
something 3
that 11
will 39
amaze 6
the 193
whole 26
room 22
and 51
be 1200
down 90
to 805
with 34
all 162
the 193
clat 5
of 109
a 6799
proverb 5
This 6
is 124
no 896
striking 3
resemblance 3
of 109
your 4
own 9
character 16
I 4330
am 392
sure 11
he 962
How 27
near 15
it 67
may 49
be 1200
to 805
mine 26
I 4330
pretend 7
to 805
say 7
You 29
think 8
it 67
a 6799
faithful 6
portrait 8
I 4330
must 28
not 85
decide 6
on 86
my 90
own 9
performance 3
He 962
made 13
no 896
answer 8
and 51
they 5
were 5
silent 6
till 14
they 5
had 11
gone 4
down 90
the 193
dance 7
when 6
he 962
her 181
if 8
she 199
and 51
her 181
did 23
not 85
often 4
walk 25
to 805
She 199
in 2719
the 193
affirmative 4
and 51
to 805
resist 17
the 193
temptation 3
When 6
you 29
met 180
us 70
there 21
the 193
other 5
day 27
we 444
had 11
just 24
a 6799
new 115
acquaintance 5
The 193
effect 15
was 93
immediate 4
A 6799
shade 4
of 109
overspread 3
his 43
but 82
he 962
not 85
a 6799
word 26
and 51
Elizabeth 5
though 12
for 484
her 181
own 9
weakness 3
not 85
go 500
on 86
At 272
length 14
spoke 14
and 51
in 2719
a 6799
manner 8
Mr 5
is 124
blessed 4
with 34
as 509
may 49
ensure 6
his 43
making 4
friends 4
he 962
may 49
be 1200
of 109
them 9
is 124
less 19
certain 5
He 962
has 41
so 797
as 509
to 805
lose 5
your 4
friendship 3
Elizabeth 5
with 34
and 51
in 2719
a 6799
manner 8
he 962
is 124
to 805
suffer 11
all 162
his 43
life 44
made 13
no 896
answer 8
and 51
of 109
the 193
subject 11
At 272
that 11
moment 14
Sir 22
William 3
close 22
to 805
them 9
meaning 11
to 805
pass 66
through 4
the 193
set 40
to 805
the 193
other 5
side 74
of 109
the 193
room 22
but 82
on 86
Mr 5
he 962
with 34
a 6799
bow 58
of 109
superior 5
to 805
compliment 6
him 9
on 86
his 43
and 51
his 43
partner 8
I 4330
have 11
most 3
my 90
dear 15
sir 22
superior 5
is 124
not 85
often 4
It 67
is 124
that 11
you 29
belong 6
to 805
the 193
first 8
Allow 9
me 1041
to 805
say 7
that 11
your 4
fair 25
partner 8
does 5
not 85
disgrace 8
you 29
and 51
that 11
I 4330
must 28
hope 16
to 805
have 11
this 6
pleasure 5
often 4
when 6
a 6799
certain 5
desirable 3
event 18
my 90
dear 15
Eliza 7
at 272
her 181
sister 9
and 51
shall 12
take 18
place 29
What 14
will 39
then 5
flow 27
in 2719
I 4330
appeal 6
to 805
Mr 5
but 82
let 50
me 1041
not 85
interrupt 11
you 29
sir 22
You 29
will 39
not 85
thank 15
me 1041
for 484
you 29
the 193
converse 5
of 109
that 11
young 9
lady 18
bright 17
eyes 8
are 12
also 3
me 1041
The 193
latter 3
part 102
of 109
this 6
address 9
was 93
by 57
but 82
Sir 22
allusion 3
to 805
his 43
friend 14
to 805
strike 14
him 9
and 51
his 43
eyes 8
were 5
with 34
a 6799
serious 4
expression 11
and 51
Jane 8
who 79
were 5
together 3
he 962
to 805
his 43
partner 8
and 51
Sir 22
interruption 3
has 41
made 13
me 1041
forget 8
what 14
we 444
were 5
of 109
I 4330
do 814
not 85
think 8
we 444
were 5
at 272
all 162
Sir 22
William 3
not 85
have 11
two 14
people 4
in 2719
the 193
room 22
who 79
had 11
less 19
to 805
say 7
for 484
We 444
have 11
two 14
or 333
three 12
success 13
and 51
what 14
we 444
are 12
to 805
talk 18
of 109
I 4330
imagine 3
What 14
think 8
you 29
of 109
books 15
he 962
Books 15
oh 17
no 896
I 4330
am 392
sure 11
we 444
never 3
read 49
the 193
same 5
or 333
not 85
with 34
the 193
same 5
I 4330
am 392
you 29
think 8
so 797
but 82
if 8
that 11
be 1200
the 193
case 25
there 21
can 287
at 272
least 3
be 1200
no 896
want 13
of 109
subject 11
We 444
may 49
compare 4
our 3
different 11
No 896
I 4330
talk 18
of 109
books 15
in 2719
a 6799
ball 77
room 22
my 90
head 140
is 124
full 16
of 109
something 3
The 193
present 20
you 29
in 2719
does 5
it 67
he 962
with 34
a 6799
look 14
of 109
doubt 15
Yes 16
she 199
knowing 3
what 14
she 199
for 484
her 181
had 11
far 91
the 193
subject 11
as 509
soon 3
by 57
her 181
I 4330
remember 4
hearing 3
you 29
say 7
Mr 5
that 11
you 29
ever 33
that 11
your 4
resentment 3
was 93
You 29
are 12
cautious 4
I 4330
suppose 4
as 509
to 805
being 3
I 4330
am 392
he 962
with 34
a 6799
firm 16
voice 8
And 51
never 3
allow 9
to 805
be 1200
by 57
prejudice 4
I 4330
hope 16
not 85
It 67
is 124
incumbent 3
on 86
who 79
never 3
change 21
opinion 4
to 805
be 1200
secure 6
of 109
at 272
first 8
May 49
I 4330
ask 6
to 805
what 14
these 4
tend 46
to 805
the 193
illustration 3
of 109
your 4
character 16
she 199
to 805
shake 19
off 100
her 181
I 4330
am 392
to 805
make 17
it 67
out 365
And 51
what 14
is 124
your 4
success 13
She 199
her 181
head 140
I 4330
do 814
not 85
get 13
on 86
at 272
all 162
I 4330
hear 76
different 11
of 109
you 29
as 509
puzzle 9
me 1041
I 4330
can 287
believe 6
he 962
that 11
may 49
with 34
respect 18
to 805
me 1041
and 51
I 4330
wish 13
Miss 71
that 11
you 29
were 5
not 85
to 805
sketch 18
my 90
character 16
at 272
the 193
present 20
moment 14
as 509
there 21
is 124
reason 13
to 805
fear 14
that 11
the 193
performance 3
would 5
reflect 12
no 896
credit 12
on 86
But 82
if 8
I 4330
do 814
not 85
take 18
your 4
likeness 3
now 10
I 4330
may 49
never 3
have 11
I 4330
would 5
by 57
no 896
suspend 7
any 17
pleasure 5
of 109
yours 3
he 962
She 199
no 896
more 11
and 51
they 5
down 90
the 193
other 5
dance 7
and 51
in 2719
silence 7
and 51
on 86
side 74
though 12
not 85
to 805
an 970
equal 17
degree 3
for 484
in 2719
breast 21
there 21
was 93
a 6799
feeling 4
her 181
soon 3
her 181
pardon 10
and 51
all 162
his 43
anger 5
They 5
had 11
not 85
long 49
when 6
Miss 71
came 36
her 181
and 51
with 34
an 970
expression 11
of 109
civil 15
disdain 7
her 181
So 797
Miss 71
Eliza 7
I 4330
hear 76
you 29
are 12
with 34
George 6
Your 4
sister 9
has 41
to 805
me 1041
him 9
and 51
me 1041
a 6799
thousand 7
and 51
I 4330
find 10
that 11
the 193
young 9
man 342
to 805
tell 16
you 29
his 43
other 5
communication 3
that 11
he 962
was 93
the 193
son 70
of 109
old 21
the 193
late 23
Mr 5
steward 10
Let 50
me 1041
recommend 8
you 29
as 509
a 6799
friend 14
not 85
to 805
give 15
implicit 4
confidence 3
to 805
all 162
his 43
for 484
as 509
to 805
Mr 5
him 9
ill 84
it 67
is 124
false 12
for 484
on 86
the 193
he 962
has 41
kind 31
to 805
him 9
though 12
George 6
has 41
Mr 5
in 2719
a 6799
most 3
manner 8
I 4330
do 814
not 85
know 12
the 193
but 82
I 4330
know 12
well 24
that 11
Mr 5
is 124
not 85
in 2719
the 193
least 3
to 805
blame 12
that 11
he 962
bear 30
to 805
hear 76
George 6
and 51
that 11
though 12
my 90
brother 9
thought 11
that 11
he 962
not 85
well 24
avoid 8
him 9
in 2719
his 43
invitation 6
to 805
the 193
he 962
was 93
glad 30
to 805
find 10
that 11
he 962
had 11
out 365
of 109
the 193
way 27
His 43
coming 3
into 26
the 193
country 12
at 272
all 162
is 124
a 6799
most 3
thing 15
and 51
I 4330
wonder 17
how 27
he 962
presume 3
to 805
do 814
it 67
I 4330
pity 4
you 29
Miss 71
Eliza 7
for 484
this 6
of 109
your 4
guilt 9
but 82
his 43
descent 3
one 19
not 85
expect 20
better 7
His 43
guilt 9
and 51
his 43
descent 3
appear 7
by 57
your 4
account 14
to 805
be 1200
the 193
same 5
Elizabeth 5
for 484
I 4330
have 11
you 29
accuse 6
him 9
of 109
nothing 5
worse 6
than 22
of 109
being 3
the 193
son 70
of 109
Mr 5
steward 10
and 51
of 109
that 11
I 4330
can 287
assure 6
you 29
he 962
me 1041
I 4330
beg 59
your 4
pardon 10
Miss 71
turning 3
with 34
a 6799
sneer 7
Excuse 4
my 90
it 67
was 93
meant 3
girl 14
Elizabeth 5
to 805
You 29
are 12
if 8
you 29
expect 20
to 805
influence 4

on 86
the 193
same 5

of 109
Jane 8
met 180
her 181
with 34
a 6799
smile 7
of 109
sweet 33
a 6799
glow 14

the 193
hope 16
of 109

But 82

vouch 11
for 484
the 193
good 28
conduct 21
the 193
and 51
of 109
his 43
friend 14
and 51
is 124
that 11
Mr 5
has 41
less 19
attention 3
Mr 5
than 22
he 962
has 41

But 82
what 14
does 5

say 7
of 109
the 193
living 5
He 962
does 5
not 85
recollect 7
the 193

I 4330
have 11
not 85
a 6799
doubt 15
of 109
Mr 5
Elizabeth 5

excuse 4
my 90

I 4330
should 7
have 11
great 12
pleasure 5
I 4330
am 392
sure 11
in 2719
the 193
with 34
an 970
air 129
for 484
I 4330
consider 13
music 24
as 509
a 6799
innocent 4
diversion 4
and 51
compatible 3
with 34
the 193
profession 14
of 109
a 6799
I 4330
do 814
not 85
mean 36
to 805
assert 11
that 11
we 444
can 287
be 1200
in 2719
too 50
of 109
our 3
time 45
to 805
music 24
for 484
there 21
are 12
other 5
to 805
be 1200
to 805
The 193
rector 6
of 109
a 6799
parish 6
has 41
to 805
do 814
In 2719
the 193
first 8
place 29
he 962
must 28
make 17
an 970
agreement 3
for 484
as 509
may 49
be 1200
to 805
and 51
not 85
offensive 6
to 805
his 43
patron 21
He 962
must 28
write 5
his 43
own 9
and 51
the 193
time 45
that 11
will 39
not 85
be 1200
too 50
for 484
his 43
parish 6

improvement 3
of 109

be 1200
making 4
as 509
comfortable 3
as 509
possible 3
And 51
I 4330
do 814
not 85
think 8
it 67
of 109
light 42
that 11
he 962
should 7
have 11
attentive 4
and 51
to 805
whom 3
he 962
his 43
I 4330
acquit 7
him 9
of 109
that 11
nor 102
I 4330
think 8
well 24
of 109
the 193
man 342
who 79
should 7
omit 4
an 970
occasion 7
of 109
his 43
respect 18
with 34
the 193
And 51
with 34
a 6799
bow 58
to 805
Mr 5
he 962
his 43
speech 13
had 11
so 797
loud 16
as 509
to 805
be 1200
by 57
half 23
the 193
room 22
but 82
no 896
one 19
more 11
than 22
Mr 5
while 4
his 43

so 797
and 51
in 2719
a 6799
half 23
whisper 8
to 805
Lady 18
that 11
he 962
was 93
a 6799
clever 6
good 28
kind 31
of 109
young 9
man 342
To 805
Elizabeth 5

an 970
agreement 3
to 805

with 34
more 11
spirit 20
or 333
finer 3
success 13

did 23
she 199
think 8
it 67
for 484
and 51
her 181
sister 9
that 11
some 30
of 109
the 193

and 51
that 11
his 43

not 85

sort 14
to 805
be 1200
by 57
the 193
he 962

have 11
That 11
his 43
two 14
and 51
Mr 5
should 7
have 11
an 970
of 109
her 181
relations 4
was 93
bad 33
and 51
she 199
not 85
determine 7
the 193
silent 6
contempt 8
of 109

Mr 5

most 3
by 57
her 181
side 74
and 51
though 12

on 86
her 181
to 805
dance 7
with 34
him 9
put 47
it 67
out 365
of 109
her 181
power 19
to 805

with 34
In 2719
vain 8
did 23
she 199
entreat 8
him 9

stand 42
up 194
with 34

was 93
by 57
delicate 7
to 805

that 11
he 962

and 51
he 962
My 90

recommendation 3
of 109

her 181
be 1200
an 970
active 6
useful 4
sort 14
of 109
person 33
not 85
up 194

Find 10

my 90
fair 25

that 11
I 4330

not 85
reckon 6
the 193
notice 8
and 51
kindness 3
of 109
Lady 18
de 2452
as 509
the 193
least 3
of 109
the 193
in 2719
my 90

to 805
offer 10
You 29

anything 3
I 4330
can 287
describe 6
and 51
your 4
wit 77
and 51
I 4330
think 8
must 28
be 1200
acceptable 3
to 805
her 181
when 6
with 34
the 193
silence 7
and 51
respect 18
her 181
rank 19
will 39
excite 10
for 484
my 90
general 22
intention 5
in 2719
of 109
it 67

you 29
there 21

young 9
women 5
But 82
the 193
fact 35
is 124
that 11
being 3
as 509
I 4330
am 392
to 805
inherit 11
this 6
estate 3
after 48
the 193
death 19
of 109
your 4

who 79
may 49
live 43
I 4330
not 85
satisfy 3
to 805

a 6799
wife 6
his 43
that 11
the 193
loss 3
to 805
them 9
might 9
be 1200
as 509
little 6
as 509
possible 3
when 6

event 18

This 6
has 41
my 90
motive 4

your 4
esteem 5

the 193
most 3
language 3
of 109

Mr 5
with 34
a 6799
formal 21
wave 23
of 109
the 193
hand 137
that 11
it 67
is 124
usual 3
with 34
young 9
to 805
reject 8
the 193
of 109
the 193
man 342
whom 3
they 5
mean 36
to 805
accept 16
when 6
he 962
first 8
for 484

that 11
the 193
refusal 3

a 6799
second 16
or 333
even 36
a 6799
third 4

my 90
declaration 3
I 4330
do 814
assure 6
you 29
that 11
I 4330
am 392
not 85
one 19
of 109
young 9
if 8
young 9
there 21
are 12
who 79
are 12
so 797
daring 3
as 509
to 805
risk 11
on 86
the 193
chance 20
of 109
being 3
a 6799
second 16
time 45

my 90
refusal 3
You 29
not 85

me 1041

friend 14
Lady 18

respect 18
ill 84
for 484
the 193

Were 5
it 67
certain 5
that 11
Lady 18
would 5
think 8
so 797
Mr 5
but 82
I 4330
imagine 3
that 11
her 181

would 5
at 272
all 162
disapprove 3
of 109
you 29
And 51

other 5
qualification 3
Mr 5

me 1041
leave 14
to 805
judge 6
for 484
and 51
pay 52
me 1041
the 193
compliment 6
of 109
what 14
I 4330
say 7
I 4330
wish 13
you 29
and 51
rich 19
and 51
by 57
your 4
hand 137
do 814
all 162
in 2719
my 90
power 19
to 805
prevent 13
your 4
being 3
In 2719

This 6

am 392

you 29
of 109
at 272
present 20
I 4330
know 12
it 67
to 805
be 1200
the 193
custom 17
of 109
your 4

a 6799
man 342
on 86
the 193
first 8
application 3
and 51
you 29
have 11
even 36
now 10
as 509
to 805
encourage 6
my 90
suit 21
as 509
would 5
be 1200

the 193
female 5
character 16
Mr 5
Elizabeth 5
with 34
some 30
you 29
puzzle 9
me 1041
If 8
what 14
I 4330
have 11
can 287
appear 7
to 805
you 29
in 2719
the 193
form 68
of 109
encouragement 3
I 4330
know 12
not 85
how 27
to 805
express 25
my 90
refusal 3
in 2719
a 6799
way 27
as 509
to 805
convince 3
you 29
of 109
being 3
one 19
You 29
must 28
give 15
me 1041
leave 14
to 805
flatter 10
my 90
dear 15
cousin 3
that 11
your 4
refusal 3
of 109
my 90
is 124
words 5
of 109
course 10
My 90
for 484
it 67
are 12
these 4
It 67
does 5
not 85
appear 7
to 805
me 1041
that 11
my 90
hand 137
is 124
of 109
your 4
acceptance 3
or 333
that 11
the 193
establishment 3
I 4330
can 287
offer 10
would 5
be 1200
any 17
other 5

desirable 3
My 90
situation 3
in 2719
life 44
my 90
with 34
the 193
of 109
de 2452
and 51
my 90
relationship 3
to 805
your 4
own 9
are 12
in 2719
my 90
and 51
you 29
should 7
take 18
it 67
into 26
further 8
consideration 3
that 11
in 2719
spite 10
of 109
your 4
manifold 5
it 67
is 124
by 57
no 896
certain 5
that 11
offer 10
of 109
marriage 6
may 49
ever 33
be 1200
made 13
you 29
Your 4
portion 5
is 124
so 797
small 14
that 11
it 67
will 39
in 2719
all 162
likelihood 3
undo 10
the 193
of 109
your 4
and 51
As 509
I 4330
must 28
conclude 3
that 11
you 29
are 12
not 85
serious 4
in 2719
your 4
rejection 3
of 109
me 1041
I 4330
shall 12
choose 5
to 805
attribute 4
it 67
to 805
your 4
wish 13
of 109
my 90
love 29
by 57
suspense 3
to 805
the 193
usual 3
practice 4
of 109
I 4330
do 814
assure 6
you 29
sir 22
that 11
I 4330
have 11
no 896
to 805
that 11
kind 31
of 109
in 2719
a 6799
man 342
I 4330
would 5
be 1200
the 193
compliment 6
of 109
being 3
sincere 4
I 4330
thank 15
you 29
and 51
for 484
the 193
you 29
have 11
done 3
me 1041
in 2719
your 4
but 82
to 805
accept 16
them 9
is 124
My 90
in 2719
every 10
respect 18
forbid 6
it 67
Can 287
I 4330
speak 12
Do 814
not 85
consider 13
me 1041
now 10
as 509
an 970
female 5
to 805
plague 4
you 29
but 82
as 509

You 29
are 12
he 962
with 34
an 970

awkward 6
and 51
I 4330
am 392

when 6
by 57
the 193

of 109
both 8
your 4
my 90

not 85
fail 12
of 109
being 3
acceptable 3
To 805
in 2719
self 11
deception 3
Elizabeth 5
would 5
make 17
no 896
reply 3
and 51
and 51
in 2719
silence 7
if 8
he 962
in 2719
her 181
as 509
encouragement 3
to 805
to 805
her 181

might 9
be 1200
in 2719
a 6799
manner 8
as 509
to 805
be 1200
decisive 4
and 51
at 272

not 85
be 1200
for 484
the 193

and 51
of 109

Chapter 3
Mr 5
was 93
not 85
left 19
long 49
to 805
the 193
silent 6
of 109
his 43

for 484
the 193

of 109
the 193

no 896
saw 24
Elizabeth 5
open 21

and 51
with 34
quick 25
step 48
pass 66
her 181

in 2719
warm 23
on 86
the 193
prospect 13
of 109
connection 3
Mr 5
and 51
these 4
with 34
equal 17
pleasure 5
and 51
then 5
to 805
relate 8
the 193
of 109
interview 11
with 34
the 193
result 8
of 109
he 962
he 962
had 11
every 10
reason 13
to 805
be 1200
since 7
the 193
refusal 3
his 43
cousin 3
had 11
given 3
him 9
would 5
flow 27
her 181
bashful 4
and 51
the 193
genuine 4
of 109
her 181
character 16
This 6
information 3
she 199
would 5
have 11
glad 30
to 805
be 1200
that 11
her 181
daughter 4
had 11
meant 3
to 805
encourage 6
him 9
by 57
his 43
but 82
she 199
dared 6
not 85
believe 6
it 67
and 51
not 85
help 23
saying 3
so 797
But 82
depend 17
it 67
Mr 5
she 199
that 11
shall 12
be 1200
to 805
reason 13
I 4330
will 39
speak 12
to 805
her 181
it 67
She 199
is 124
a 6799
foolish 4
girl 14
and 51
does 5
not 85
know 12
her 181

know 12
it 67
Pardon 10
me 1041
for 484
you 29
madam 5
Mr 5
but 82
if 8
she 199
is 124
and 51
foolish 4
I 4330
know 12
not 85
she 199
would 5
be 1200
a 6799
desirable 3
wife 6
to 805
a 6799
man 342

my 90
situation 3
who 79

state 41
If 8
she 199
in 2719
my 90
suit 21
it 67
were 5
better 7
not 85
to 805
force 10
her 181

Sir 22

In 2719
she 199
is 124
as 509
good 28
a 6799
girl 14
as 509
ever 33
I 4330
will 39
go 500
to 805
Mr 5
and 51
we 444
shall 12
soon 3
settle 10
it 67
with 34
her 181
I 4330
am 392
sure 11
She 199
would 5
not 85
give 15
him 9
time 45
to 805
reply 3
but 82

Oh 17

if 8
you 29

not 85
make 17
haste 8
he 962
will 39
change 21

And 51

An 970

Mr 5

this 6
way 27
You 29

My 90

I 4330

two 14
small 14
to 805

First 8
that 11
you 29

allow 9
me 1041
the 193
free 93
use 18
of 109
my 90

have 11
the 193
to 805
as 509
soon 3
as 509
may 49
be 1200
Not 85
yet 4
in 2719
spite 10
of 109
her 181
disappointment 3
in 2719
her 181
husband 10
did 23
give 15
up 194
the 193
point 22
She 199
to 805
Elizabeth 5

turns 4
She 199

Jane 8

Mr 5
was 93

on 86
what 14
had 11
He 962
thought 11
too 50
well 24
of 109
to 805
comprehend 4
on 86
what 14
his 43
cousin 3

his 43
pride 6
was 93
hurt 12
he 962
in 2719
no 896
other 5
way 27
His 43
regard 7
for 484
her 181

be 1200
able 3
to 805
see 70
your 4
friends 4
they 5
leave 14
the 193
country 12
But 82
may 49
we 444
not 85
hope 16
that 11
the 193
period 16
of 109
future 3
to 805
Miss 71
forward 12
may 49
arrive 3
than 22
she 199
is 124
aware 3
and 51
that 11
the 193
you 29
have 11
as 509
friends 4
will 39
be 1200
with 34
yet 4
satisfaction 3
as 509
Mr 5
will 39
not 85
be 1200
in 2719
London 5
by 57
them 9
that 11
none 32
of 109
the 193
party 3
will 39
return 14
into 26
this 6
winter 13
I 4330
will 39
read 49
it 67
to 805
you 29
When 6
my 90
brother 9
left 19
us 70
yesterday 3
he 962
that 11
the 193
business 13
him 9
to 805
London 5
might 9
be 1200
in 2719
three 12
or 333
four 26
but 82
as 509
we 444
are 12
certain 5
it 67
be 1200
so 797
and 51
at 272
the 193
same 5
time 45
that 11
when 6
Charles 5
to 805
town 27
he 962
will 39
be 1200
in 2719
no 896
hurry 3
to 805
leave 14
it 67
we 444
have 11
on 86
following 3
him 9
that 11
he 962
may 49
not 85
be 1200
to 805
spend 11
his 43
in 2719
a 6799
hotel 6
of 109
my 90
acquaintances 3
are 12
there 21
for 484
the 193
winter 13
I 4330
wish 13
that 11
I 4330
hear 76
that 11
you 29
my 90
friend 14
had 11
any 17
intention 5
of 109
making 4
one 19
of 109
the 193
crowd 5
but 82
of 109
that 11
I 4330
despair 6
I 4330
hope 16
your 4
Christmas 9
in 2719
may 49
abound 4
in 2719
the 193
that 11
season 12
and 51
that 11
your 4
will 39
be 1200
so 797
as 509
to 805
prevent 13
your 4
feeling 4
the 193
loss 3
of 109
the 193
three 12
of 109
whom 3
we 444
shall 12
deprive 3
you 29
It 67
is 124
by 57
this 6
Jane 8
that 11
he 962
comes 4
back 182
no 896
more 11
this 6
winter 13
It 67
is 124
that 11
Miss 71
does 5
not 85
mean 36
that 11
he 962
should 7
Why 4
will 39
you 29
think 8
so 797
It 67
must 28
be 1200
his 43
own 9
doing 3
He 962
is 124
his 43
own 9
master 28
But 82
you 29
do 814
not 85
know 12
all 162
I 4330
will 39
read 49
you 29
the 193
passage 6
me 1041
I 4330
will 39
have 11
no 896
you 29
Mr 5
is 124
to 805
see 70
his 43
sister 9
and 51
to 805
confess 14
the 193
truth 7
we 444
are 12
less 19
eager 6
to 805
meet 9
her 181
I 4330
do 814
not 85
think 8
has 41
her 181
equal 17
for 484
and 51
and 51
the 193
affection 5
she 199
in 2719
and 51
is 124
into 26
something 3
still 13
more 11
the 193
hope 16
we 444
dare 15
entertain 12
of 109
her 181
being 3
hereafter 3
our 3
sister 9
I 4330
do 814
not 85
know 12
I 4330
ever 33
to 805
you 29
my 90
on 86
this 6
subject 11
but 82
I 4330
will 39
not 85
leave 14
the 193
country 12
them 9
and 51
I 4330
trust 26
you 29
will 39
not 85
esteem 5
them 9
unreasonable 3
My 90
brother 9
her 181
he 962
will 39
have 11
frequent 9
now 10
of 109
her 181
on 86
the 193
most 3
intimate 5
footing 3
her 181
relations 4
all 162
wish 13
the 193
connection 3
as 509
as 509
his 43
own 9
and 51
a 6799
is 124
not 85
me 1041
I 4330
think 8
when 6
I 4330
call 57
Charles 5
most 3
of 109
any 17
heart 57
With 34
all 162
these 4
to 805
an 970
attachment 3
and 51
nothing 5
to 805
prevent 13
it 67
am 392
I 4330
wrong 24
my 90
Jane 8
in 2719
the 193
hope 16
of 109
an 970
event 18
will 39
secure 6
the 193
of 109
so 797
What 14
do 814
you 29
think 8
of 109
this 6
sentence 4
my 90
dear 15
Jane 8
as 509
she 199
it 67
Is 124
it 67
not 85
clear 23
Does 5
it 67
not 85
declare 6
that 11
nor 102
me 1041
to 805
be 1200
her 181
sister 9
that 11
she 199
is 124
of 109
her 181
and 51
that 11
if 8
she 199
the 193
nature 3
of 109
my 90
for 484
him 9
she 199
most 3
to 805
put 47
me 1041
on 86
my 90
guard 26
Can 287
there 21
be 1200
any 17
other 5
opinion 4
on 86
the 193
subject 11
Yes 16
there 21
can 287
for 484
mine 26
is 124
different 11
Will 39
you 29
hear 76
it 67
Most 3
You 29
shall 12
have 11
it 67
in 2719
a 6799
few 6
words 5
Miss 71
sees 6
that 11
her 181
brother 9
is 124
in 2719
love 29
with 34
you 29
and 51
him 9
to 805
Miss 71
She 199
him 9
to 805
town 27
in 2719
hope 16
of 109
him 9
there 21
and 51
to 805
persuade 6
you 29
that 11
he 962
does 5
not 85
care 47
you 29
Jane 8
her 181
head 140
Jane 8
you 29
to 805
believe 6
me 1041
No 896
one 19
who 79
has 41
ever 33
you 29
together 3
can 287
doubt 15
his 43
affection 5
Miss 71
I 4330
am 392
sure 11
She 199
is 124
not 85
a 6799
simpleton 3
she 199
have 11
half 23
as 509
love 29
in 2719
Mr 5
for 484
she 199
would 5
have 11
her 181
wedding 3
clothes 10
But 82
the 193
case 25
is 124
this 6
We 444
are 12
not 85
rich 19
or 333
grand 74
for 484
them 9
and 51
she 199
is 124
the 193
more 11
anxious 4
to 805
get 13
Miss 71
for 484
her 181
brother 9
the 193
notion 5
that 11
when 6
there 21
has 41
one 19
intermarriage 3
she 199
may 49
have 11
less 19
trouble 18
in 2719
a 6799
second 16
in 2719
there 21
is 124
some 30
and 51
I 4330
dare 15
say 7
it 67
would 5
succeed 4
if 8
Miss 71
de 2452
were 5
out 365
of 109
the 193
way 27
But 82
my 90
Jane 8
you 29
imagine 3
that 11
Miss 71
you 29
her 181
brother 9
Miss 71
he 962
is 124
in 2719
the 193
degree 3
less 19
sensible 3
of 109
your 4
merit 13
than 22
when 6
he 962
leave 14
of 109
you 29
on 86
Tuesday 3
or 333
that 11
it 67
will 39
be 1200
in 2719
her 181
power 19
to 805
persuade 6
him 9
that 11
of 109
being 3
in 2719
love 29
with 34
you 29
he 962
is 124
in 2719
love 29
with 34
her 181
friend 14
If 8
we 444
thought 11
of 109
Miss 71
Jane 8
your 4
representation 4
of 109
all 162
this 6
might 9
make 17
me 1041
But 82
I 4330
know 12
the 193
foundation 3
is 124
unjust 5
is 124
of 109
and 51
all 162
that 11
I 4330
can 287
hope 16
in 2719
this 6
case 25
is 124
that 11
she 199
is 124
That 11
is 124
right 31
You 29
not 85
have 11
a 6799
more 11
idea 21
since 7
you 29
will 39
not 85
take 18
comfort 14
in 2719
mine 26
Believe 6
her 181
to 805
be 1200
by 57
all 162
You 29
have 11
now 10
done 3
your 4
by 57
her 181
and 51
must 28
fret 14
no 896
But 82
my 90
dear 15
sister 9
can 287
I 4330
be 1200
even 36
the 193
best 37
in 2719
a 6799
man 342
and 51
friends 4
are 12
all 162
him 9
to 805
You 29
must 28
decide 6
for 484
Elizabeth 5
and 51
if 8
mature 6
deliberation 3
you 29
find 10
that 11
the 193
of 109
his 43
two 14
is 124
more 11
than 22
equivalent 4
to 805
the 193
of 109
being 3
his 43
wife 6
I 4330
advise 9
you 29
by 57
all 162
to 805
refuse 4
him 9
How 27
can 287
you 29
talk 18
so 797
Jane 8
You 29
must 28
know 12
that 11
though 12
I 4330
should 7
be 1200
at 272
I 4330
not 85
hesitate 3
I 4330
did 23
not 85
think 8
you 29
would 5
and 51
that 11
being 3
the 193
case 25
I 4330
consider 13
your 4
situation 3
with 34
compassion 4
But 82
if 8
he 962
no 896
more 11
this 6
winter 13
my 90
choice 5
will 39
never 3
be 1200
A 6799
thousand 7
may 49
arise 3
in 2719
six 24
The 193
idea 21
of 109
his 43
no 896
more 11
Elizabeth 5
with 34
the 193
contempt 8
It 67
to 805
her 181
the 193
suggestion 3
of 109
and 51
she 199
not 85
for 484
a 6799
moment 14
suppose 4
that 11
or 333
influence 4
a 6799
young 9
man 342
so 797
independent 4
of 109
She 199
to 805
her 181
sister 9
as 509
as 509
possible 3
what 14
she 199
felt 5
on 86
the 193
subject 11
and 51
had 11
soon 3
the 193
pleasure 5
of 109
effect 15
temper 22
was 93
not 85
and 51
she 199
was 93
led 11
to 805
hope 16
though 12
the 193
of 109
affection 5
the 193
hope 16
that 11
would 5
return 14
to 805
and 51
answer 8
every 10
wish 13
of 109
her 181
heart 57
They 5
that 11
should 7
hear 76
of 109
the 193
departure 3
of 109
the 193
being 3
on 86
the 193
score 19
of 109
the 193
conduct 21
but 82
even 36
this 6
partial 6
communication 3
gave 4
her 181
a 6799
great 12
deal 13
of 109
concern 6
and 51
she 199
it 67
as 509
that 11
the 193
should 7
happen 9
to 805
go 500
just 24
as 509
they 5
were 5
all 162
so 797
intimate 5
together 3
After 48
it 67
at 272
some 30
length 14
she 199
had 11
the 193
consolation 3
that 11
Mr 5
would 5
be 1200
soon 3
down 90
and 51
soon 3
at 272
and 51
the 193
conclusion 3
of 109
all 162
was 93
the 193
comfortable 3
declaration 3
that 11
though 12
he 962
had 11
to 805
a 6799
dinner 9
she 199
would 5
take 18
care 47
to 805
have 11
two 14
full 16
Chapter 3
The 193
were 5
to 805
dine 9
with 34
the 193
and 51
the 193
chief 14
of 109
the 193
day 27
was 93
Miss 71
so 797
kind 31
as 509
to 805
listen 9
to 805
Mr 5
Elizabeth 5
an 970
of 109
her 181
It 67
keeps 4
him 9
in 2719
good 28
she 199
and 51
I 4330
am 392
more 11
to 805
you 29
than 22
I 4330
can 287
express 25
Charlotte 4
assured 4
her 181
friend 14
of 109
her 181
satisfaction 3
in 2719
being 3
useful 4
and 51
that 11
it 67
her 181
for 484
the 193
little 6
sacrifice 4
of 109
her 181
time 45
This 6
was 93
but 82
kindness 3
than 22
Elizabeth 5
had 11
any 17
conception 4
of 109
object 26
was 93
nothing 5
than 22
to 805
secure 6
her 181
any 17
return 14
of 109
Mr 5
by 57
them 9
was 93
Miss 71
scheme 7
and 51
were 5
so 797
that 11
when 6
they 5
at 272
night 61
she 199
would 5
have 11
felt 5
secure 6
of 109
success 13
if 8
he 962
had 11
not 85
to 805
leave 14
so 797
soon 3
But 82
here 31
she 199
did 23
injustice 3
to 805
the 193
fire 103
and 51
of 109
his 43
character 16
for 484
it 67
led 11

irksome 4

his 43
attachment 3

With 34
proper 9
the 193
then 5
all 162
of 109
them 9
that 11
he 962
a 6799
quick 25
return 14
to 805
understand 8
by 57
it 67
that 11
he 962
thought 11
of 109
his 43
to 805
one 19
of 109
her 181
and 51
Mary 13
might 9
have 11
on 86
to 805
accept 16
him 9
She 199
his 43
than 22
any 17
of 109
the 193
there 21
was 93
a 6799
in 2719
his 43
often 4
her 181
and 51
though 12
by 57
no 896
so 797
clever 6
as 509
she 199
thought 11
that 11
if 8
to 805
read 49
and 51
improve 6
by 57
an 970
example 4
as 509
hers 9
he 962
might 9
a 6799
agreeable 3
companion 10
But 82
on 86
the 193
following 3
morning 3
every 10
hope 16
of 109
this 6
kind 31
was 93
done 3
Miss 71
soon 3
after 48
breakfast 5
and 51
in 2719
a 6799
private 9
conference 3
with 34
Elizabeth 5
related 3
the 193
event 18
of 109
the 193
day 27
The 193
of 109
Mr 5
in 2719
love 29
with 34
her 181
friend 14
had 11
to 805
Elizabeth 5
within 3
the 193
last 7
day 27
or 333
two 14
but 82
that 11
Charlotte 4
encourage 6
him 9
as 509
far 91
as 509
she 199
encourage 6
him 9
and 51
her 181
was 93
so 797
great 12
as 509
to 805
at 272
first 8
the 193
of 109
and 51
she 199
not 85
help 23
out 365
to 805
Mr 5
My 90
dear 15
Charlotte 4
The 193
steady 3
countenance 4
Miss 71
had 11
in 2719
her 181
story 13
gave 4
way 27
to 805
a 6799
confusion 3
here 31
on 86
so 797
direct 30
a 6799
reproach 8
though 12
as 509
it 67
was 93
no 896
more 11
than 22
she 199
she 199
soon 3
her 181
and 51
Why 4
should 7
you 29
be 1200
my 90
dear 15
Eliza 7
Do 814
you 29
think 8
it 67
that 11
Mr 5
should 7
be 1200
able 3
to 805
procure 8
any 17
good 28
opinion 4
he 962
was 93
not 85
so 797
as 509
to 805
succeed 4
with 34
you 29
But 82
Elizabeth 5
had 11
now 10
and 51
making 4
a 6799
strong 16
effort 7
for 484
it 67
was 93
able 3
to 805
assure 6
with 34
that 11
the 193
prospect 13
of 109
relationship 3
was 93
grateful 4
to 805
her 181
and 51
that 11
she 199
her 181
all 162
I 4330
see 70
what 14
you 29
are 12
feeling 4
Charlotte 4
You 29
must 28
be 1200
so 797
as 509
Mr 5
was 93
to 805
you 29
But 82
when 6
you 29
have 11
had 11
time 45
to 805
think 8
it 67
over 596
I 4330
hope 16
you 29
will 39
be 1200
with 34
what 14
I 4330
have 11
done 3
I 4330
am 392
not 85
romantic 13
you 29
know 12
I 4330
never 3
was 93
I 4330
ask 6
a 6799
comfortable 3
home 90
and 51
Mr 5
character 16
connection 3
and 51
situation 3
in 2719
life 44
I 4330
am 392
that 11
my 90
chance 20
of 109
with 34
him 9
is 124
as 509
fair 25
as 509
most 3
people 4
can 287
boast 12
on 86
the 193
marriage 6
state 41
Elizabeth 5
and 51
after 48
an 970
awkward 6
pause 4
they 5
to 805
the 193
rest 110
of 109
the 193
Charlotte 4
did 23
not 85
stay 7
and 51
Elizabeth 5
was 93
then 5
left 19
to 805
reflect 12
on 86
what 14
she 199
had 11
It 67
was 93
a 6799
long 49
time 45
she 199
at 272
all 162
to 805
the 193
idea 21
of 109
so 797
a 6799
match 25
The 193
of 109
Mr 5
making 4
two 14
of 109
marriage 6
within 3
three 12
was 93
nothing 5
in 2719
comparison 3
of 109
his 43
being 3
now 10
She 199
had 11
felt 5
that 11
opinion 4
of 109
was 93
not 85
like 22
her 181
own 9
but 82
she 199
had 11
not 85
it 67
to 805
be 1200
possible 3
that 11
when 6
into 26
action 4

If 8

she 199
thought 11
he 962

It 67

a 6799
subject 11

A 6799

Jane 8
had 11
courage 6
to 805
speak 12

to 805
Elizabeth 5
but 82
at 272
last 7
on 86
leaving 3
them 9
together 3
after 48
a 6799
irritation 3
than 22
usual 3
and 51
master 28
she 199
not 85

saying 3
Oh 17
that 11
my 90
dear 15

more 11
command 21
over 596
She 199
can 287

by 57
her 181
on 86
him 9
But 82
I 4330
will 39
not 85
repine 3
It 67
last 7
long 49
He 962
will 39
be 1200
and 51
we 444
shall 12
all 162
be 1200
as 509
we 444
were 5
Elizabeth 5
at 272
her 181
sister 9
with 34
but 82
nothing 5
You 29
doubt 15
me 1041
Jane 8
you 29
have 11
no 896
reason 13
He 962
may 49
live 43
in 2719
my 90
as 509
the 193
most 3
man 342
of 109
my 90
acquaintance 5
but 82
that 11
is 124
all 162
I 4330
have 11
nothing 5
to 805
hope 16
or 333
fear 14
and 51
nothing 5
to 805
reproach 8
him 9
with 34
Thank 15
God 61
I 4330
have 11
not 85
that 11
pain 42
A 6799
little 6
time 45
I 4330
shall 12
try 12
to 805
get 13
the 193
better 7
With 34
a 6799
voice 8
she 199
soon 3
I 4330
have 11
this 6
comfort 14
that 11
it 67
has 41
not 85
more 11
than 22
an 970
error 3
of 109
fancy 5
on 86
my 90
side 74
and 51
that 11
it 67
has 41
done 3
no 896
harm 41
to 805
but 82
My 90
dear 15
Jane 8
Elizabeth 5
you 29
are 12
too 50
good 28
Your 4
and 51
are 12
angelic 6
I 4330
do 814
not 85
know 12
what 14
to 805
say 7
to 805
you 29
I 4330
feel 11
as 509
if 8
I 4330
had 11
never 3
done 3
you 29
justice 3
or 333
you 29
as 509
you 29
deserve 4
Miss 71
all 162
merit 13
and 51
back 182
the 193
praise 7
on 86
her 181
warm 23
affection 5
Nay 6
Elizabeth 5
this 6
is 124
not 85
fair 25
You 29
wish 13
to 805
think 8
all 162
the 193
world 12
and 51
are 12
hurt 12
if 8
I 4330
speak 12
ill 84
of 109
I 4330
want 13
to 805
think 8
you 29
perfect 24
and 51
you 29
set 40
it 67
Do 814
not 85
be 1200
of 109
my 90
into 26
any 17
excess 5
of 109
my 90
on 86
your 4
privilege 4
of 109
universal 10
good 28
will 39
You 29
need 29
not 85
There 21
are 12
few 6
people 4
whom 3
I 4330
love 29
and 51
still 13
of 109
whom 3
I 4330
think 8
well 24
The 193
more 11
I 4330
see 70
of 109
the 193
world 12
the 193
more 11
am 392
I 4330
with 34
it 67
and 51
every 10
day 27
my 90
belief 3
of 109
the 193
of 109
all 162
human 41
and 51
of 109
the 193
little 6
that 11
can 287
be 1200
on 86
the 193
appearance 3
of 109
merit 13
or 333
sense 8
I 4330
have 11
met 180
with 34
two 14
one 19
I 4330
will 39
not 85
mention 5
the 193
other 5
is 124
marriage 6
It 67
is 124
In 2719
every 10
view 18
it 67
is 124
My 90
dear 15
do 814
not 85
give 15
way 27
to 805
as 509
these 4
They 5
will 39
ruin 10
your 4
You 29
do 814
not 85
make 17
allowance 3
for 484
difference 3
of 109
situation 3
and 51
temper 22
Consider 13
Mr 5
and 51
steady 3
prudent 5
character 16
Remember 4
that 11
she 199
is 124
one 19
of 109
a 6799
large 11
that 11
as 509
to 805
fortune 8
it 67
is 124
a 6799
most 3
match 25
and 51
be 1200
to 805
believe 6
for 484
that 11
she 199
may 49
feel 11
something 3
like 22
regard 7
and 51
esteem 5
for 484
our 3
cousin 3
To 805
oblige 3
you 29
I 4330
would 5
try 12
to 805
believe 6
anything 3
but 82
no 896
one 19
be 1200
by 57
a 6799
belief 3
as 509
this 6
for 484
were 5
I 4330
that 11
Charlotte 4
had 11
any 17
regard 7
for 484
him 9
I 4330
should 7
think 8
worse 6
of 109
her 181
understanding 4
than 22
I 4330
now 10
do 814
of 109
her 181
heart 57
My 90
dear 15
Jane 8
Mr 5
is 124
a 6799
conceited 4
pompous 4
narrow 10
man 342
you 29
know 12
he 962
is 124
as 509
well 24
as 509
I 4330
do 814
and 51
you 29
must 28
feel 11
as 509
well 24
as 509
I 4330
do 814
that 11
the 193
woman 21
who 79
married 3
him 9
have 11
a 6799
proper 9
way 27
of 109
You 29
shall 12
not 85
defend 10
her 181
though 12
it 67
is 124
Charlotte 4
You 29
shall 12
not 85
for 484
the 193
of 109
one 19
individual 19
change 21
the 193
meaning 11
of 109
principle 4
and 51
nor 102
to 805
persuade 6
or 333
me 1041
that 11
is 124
and 51
of 109
danger 7
for 484
I 4330
must 28
think 8
your 4
language 3
too 50
strong 16
in 2719
of 109
both 8
Jane 8
and 51
I 4330
hope 16
you 29
will 39
be 1200
of 109
it 67
by 57
them 9
together 3
But 82
of 109
this 6
You 29
to 805
something 3
You 29
two 14
I 4330
misunderstand 5
you 29
but 82
I 4330
entreat 8
you 29
dear 15
not 85
to 805
pain 42
me 1041
by 57
that 11
person 33
to 805
blame 12
and 51
saying 3
your 4
opinion 4
of 109
him 9
is 124
sunk 4
We 444
must 28
not 85
be 1200
so 797
to 805
fancy 5
We 444
must 28
not 85
expect 20
a 6799
young 9
man 342
to 805
be 1200
so 797
and 51
circumspect 4
It 67
is 124
often 4
nothing 5
but 82
our 3
own 9
that 11
us 70
Women 5
fancy 5
more 11
than 22
it 67
does 5
And 51
men 140
take 18
care 47
that 11
they 5
should 7
If 8
it 67
is 124
done 3
they 5
be 1200
but 82
I 4330
have 11
no 896
idea 21
of 109
there 21
being 3
so 797
design 16
in 2719
the 193
world 12
as 509
some 30
imagine 3
I 4330
am 392
far 91
any 17
part 102
of 109
Mr 5
conduct 21
to 805
design 16
Elizabeth 5
but 82
to 805
do 814
wrong 24
or 333
to 805
make 17
there 21
may 49
be 1200
error 3
and 51
there 21
may 49
be 1200
want 13
of 109
attention 3
to 805
other 5
and 51
want 13
of 109
resolution 3
will 39
do 814
the 193
business 13
And 51
do 814
you 29
impute 3
it 67
to 805
of 109
Yes 16
to 805
the 193
last 7
But 82
if 8
I 4330
go 500
on 86
I 4330
shall 12
displease 3
you 29
by 57
saying 3
what 14
I 4330
think 8
of 109
you 29
esteem 5
Stop 36
me 1041
you 29
can 287
You 29
persist 8
then 5
in 2719
his 43
influence 4
him 9
Yes 16
in 2719
conjunction 3
with 34
his 43
friend 14
I 4330
believe 6
it 67
Why 4
should 7
they 5
try 12
to 805
influence 4
him 9
They 5
can 287
wish 13
his 43
and 51
if 8
he 962
is 124
to 805
me 1041
no 896
other 5
woman 21
can 287
secure 6
it 67
Your 4
first 8
position 6
is 124
false 12
They 5
may 49
wish 13
his 43
they 5
may 49
wish 13
his 43
increase 4
of 109
wealth 7
and 51
consequence 3
they 5
may 49
wish 13
him 9
to 805
a 6799
girl 14
who 79
has 41
all 162
the 193
of 109
money 17
great 12
and 51
pride 6
a 6799
doubt 15
they 5
do 814
wish 13
him 9
to 805
choose 5
Miss 71
Jane 8
but 82
this 6
may 49
be 1200
better 7
than 22
you 29
are 12
They 5
have 11
her 181
than 22
they 5
have 11
me 1041
no 896
wonder 17
if 8
they 5
love 29
her 181
better 7
But 82
may 49
be 1200
own 9
it 67
is 124
they 5
should 7
have 11
What 14
sister 9
would 5
think 8
at 272
to 805
do 814
it 67
there 21
were 5
something 3
If 8
they 5
him 9
to 805
me 1041
they 5
would 5
not 85
try 12
to 805
part 102
us 70
if 8
he 962
were 5
so 797
they 5
not 85
succeed 4
By 57
an 970
affection 5
you 29
make 17
and 51
wrong 24
and 51
me 1041
most 3
Do 814
not 85
distress 7
me 1041
by 57
the 193
idea 21
I 4330
am 392
not 85
of 109
or 333
at 272
least 3
it 67
is 124
light 42
it 67
is 124
nothing 5
in 2719
comparison 3
of 109
what 14
I 4330
should 7
feel 11
in 2719
ill 84
of 109
him 9
or 333
his 43
Let 50
me 1041
take 18
it 67
in 2719
the 193
best 37
light 42
in 2719
the 193
light 42
in 2719
it 67
may 49
be 1200
Elizabeth 5
not 85
oppose 3
a 6799
wish 13
and 51
this 6
time 45
Mr 5
name 17
was 93
ever 33
them 9
still 13
to 805
wonder 17
and 51
repine 3
at 272
his 43
no 896
more 11
and 51
though 12
a 6799
day 27
in 2719
Elizabeth 5
did 23
not 85
account 14
for 484
it 67
there 21
was 93
little 6
chance 20
of 109
her 181
ever 33
it 67
with 34
less 19
Her 181
daughter 4
to 805
convince 3
her 181
of 109
what 14
she 199
did 23
not 85
believe 6
that 11
his 43
to 805
Jane 8
had 11
the 193
effect 15
of 109
a 6799
common 23
and 51
transient 4
when 6
he 962
saw 24
her 181
no 896
more 11
but 82
though 12
the 193
of 109
the 193
statement 5
was 93
at 272
the 193
time 45
she 199
had 11
the 193
same 5
story 13
to 805
repeat 12
every 10
day 27
best 37
comfort 14
was 93
that 11
Mr 5
must 28
be 1200
down 90
in 2719
the 193
summer 13
Mr 5
the 193
matter 7
So 797
he 962
one 19
day 27
your 4
sister 9
is 124
in 2719
love 29
I 4330
find 10
I 4330
congratulate 3
her 181
to 805
being 3
married 3
a 6799
girl 14
to 805
be 1200
a 6799
little 6
in 2719
love 29
now 10
and 51
then 5
It 67
is 124
something 3
to 805
think 8
of 109
and 51
it 67
her 181
a 6799
sort 14
of 109
distinction 3
her 181
companions 3
When 6
is 124
your 4
turn 46
to 805
come 36
You 29
will 39
bear 30
to 805
be 1200
long 49
by 57
Jane 8
Now 10
is 124
your 4
time 45
Here 31
are 12
in 2719
to 805
disappoint 8
all 162
the 193
young 9
in 2719
the 193
country 12
Let 50
be 1200
your 4
man 342
He 962
is 124
a 6799
pleasant 9
fellow 9
and 51
would 5
jilt 5
you 29
Thank 15
you 29
sir 22
but 82
a 6799
less 19
agreeable 3
man 342
would 5
satisfy 3
me 1041
We 444
must 28
not 85
all 162
expect 20
good 28
fortune 8
True 9
Mr 5
but 82
it 67
is 124
a 6799
comfort 14
to 805
think 8
that 11
of 109
that 11
kind 31
may 49
befall 4
you 29
you 29
have 11
an 970
mother 21
who 79
will 39
make 17
the 193
most 3
of 109
it 67
Mr 5
was 93
of 109
material 17
service 13
in 2719
the 193
gloom 8
the 193
late 23
perverse 4
had 11
on 86
of 109
the 193
They 5
saw 24
him 9
often 4
and 51
to 805
his 43
other 5
was 93
now 10
that 11
of 109
general 22
The 193
whole 26
of 109
what 14
Elizabeth 5
had 11
his 43
on 86
Mr 5
and 51
all 162
that 11
he 962
had 11
him 9
was 93
now 10
and 51
and 51
was 93
to 805
know 12
how 27
they 5
had 11
Mr 5
they 5
had 11
anything 3
of 109
the 193
matter 7
Miss 71
was 93
the 193
creature 3
who 79
suppose 4
there 21
might 9
be 1200
any 17
in 2719
the 193
case 25
unknown 3
to 805
the 193
of 109
her 181
mild 14
and 51
steady 3
for 484
and 51
the 193
of 109
but 82
by 57
Mr 5
was 93
as 509
the 193
worst 6
of 109
men 140
Chapter 3
After 48
a 6799
week 20
in 2719
of 109
love 29
and 51
of 109
Mr 5
was 93
his 43
Charlotte 4
by 57
the 193
arrival 3
of 109
Saturday 3
The 193
pain 42
of 109
separation 3
might 9
be 1200
on 86
his 43
side 74
by 57
for 484
the 193
reception 6
of 109
his 43
bride 9
as 509
he 962
had 11
reason 13
to 805
hope 16
that 11
after 48
his 43
return 14
into 26
the 193
day 27
would 5
be 1200
that 11
was 93
to 805
make 17
him 9
the 193
of 109
men 140
He 962
leave 14
of 109
his 43
relations 4
at 272
with 34
as 509
as 509
his 43
fair 25
health 12
and 51
and 51
father 12
letter 20
of 109
thanks 4
On 86
the 193
following 3
Monday 3
had 11
the 193
pleasure 5
of 109
her 181
brother 9
and 51
his 43
wife 6
who 79
came 36
as 509
usual 3
to 805
spend 11
the 193
Christmas 9
at 272
Mr 5
was 93
a 6799
sensible 3
man 342
superior 5
to 805
his 43
sister 9
as 509
well 24
by 57
nature 3
as 509
education 9
The 193
would 5
have 11
had 11
in 2719
that 11
a 6799
man 342
who 79
by 57
trade 20
and 51
within 3
view 18
of 109
his 43
own 9
have 11
so 797
well 24
and 51
agreeable 3
who 79
was 93
several 3
than 22
and 51
was 93
an 970
intelligent 4
woman 21
and 51
a 6799
great 12
with 34
all 162
her 181
the 193
two 14
and 51
there 21
a 6799
particular 13
regard 7
They 5
had 11
with 34
her 181
in 2719
town 27
The 193
first 8
part 102
of 109
business 13
on 86
her 181
arrival 3
was 93
to 805
distribute 3
her 181
and 51
describe 6
the 193
When 6
this 6
was 93
done 3
she 199
had 11
a 6799
less 19
active 6
part 102
to 805
play 73
It 67
her 181
turn 46
to 805
listen 9
had 11
to 805
relate 8
and 51
to 805
complain 13
of 109
They 5
had 11
all 162
ill 84
since 7
she 199
last 7
saw 24
her 181
sister 9
Two 14
of 109
her 181
had 11
the 193
point 22
of 109
marriage 6
and 51
after 48
all 162
there 21
was 93
nothing 5
in 2719
it 67
I 4330
do 814
not 85
blame 12
Jane 8
she 199
for 484
Jane 8
would 5
have 11
got 14
Mr 5
if 8
she 199
But 82
Oh 17
sister 9
It 67
is 124
hard 70
to 805
think 8
that 11
she 199
might 9
have 11
Mr 5
wife 6
by 57
this 6
time 45
had 11
it 67
not 85
for 484
her 181
own 9
He 962
made 13
her 181
an 970
offer 10
in 2719
this 6
room 22
and 51
she 199
him 9
The 193
consequence 3
of 109
it 67
is 124
that 11
Lady 18
will 39
have 11
a 6799
daughter 4
married 3
I 4330
have 11
and 51
that 11
the 193
estate 3
is 124
just 24
as 509
as 509
ever 33
The 193
are 12
artful 4
people 4
sister 9
They 5
are 12
all 162
for 484
what 14
they 5
can 287
get 13
I 4330
am 392
to 805
say 7
it 67
of 109
them 9
but 82
so 797
it 67
is 124
It 67
makes 4
me 1041
nervous 4
and 51
to 805
be 1200
so 797
in 2719
my 90
own 9
and 51
to 805
have 11
who 79
think 8
of 109
your 4
coming 3
just 24
at 272
this 6
time 45
is 124
the 193
of 109
and 51
I 4330
am 392
glad 30
to 805
hear 76
what 14
you 29
tell 16
us 70
of 109
long 49
to 805
whom 3
the 193
chief 14
of 109
this 6
news 71
had 11
given 3
in 2719
the 193
course 10
of 109
Jane 8
and 51
correspondence 3
with 34
her 181
made 13
her 181
sister 9
a 6799
slight 10
answer 8
and 51
in 2719
compassion 4
to 805
her 181
the 193
conversation 8
When 6
with 34
Elizabeth 5
she 199
spoke 14
more 11
on 86
the 193
subject 11
It 67
to 805
have 11
a 6799
desirable 3
match 25
for 484
Jane 8
she 199
I 4330
am 392
it 67
off 100
But 82
these 4
happen 9
so 797
often 4
A 6799
young 9
man 342
as 509
you 29
describe 6
Mr 5
so 797
in 2719
love 29
with 34
a 6799
pretty 3
girl 14
for 484
a 6799
few 6
and 51
when 6
accident 7
them 9
so 797
her 181
that 11
these 4
sort 14
of 109
are 12
frequent 9
An 970
consolation 3
in 2719
way 27
Elizabeth 5
but 82
it 67
will 39
not 85
do 814
for 484
us 70
We 444
do 814
not 85
suffer 11
by 57
accident 7
It 67
does 5
not 85
often 4
happen 9
that 11
the 193
of 109
friends 4
will 39
persuade 6
a 6799
young 9
man 342
of 109
independent 4
fortune 8
to 805
think 8
no 896
more 11
of 109
a 6799
girl 14
whom 3
he 962
was 93
in 2719
love 29
with 34
a 6799
few 6
But 82
that 11
expression 11
of 109
in 2719
is 124
so 797
so 797
doubtful 4
so 797
indefinite 4
that 11
it 67
me 1041
little 6
idea 21
It 67
is 124
as 509
often 4
to 805
arise 3
a 6799
half 23
acquaintance 5
as 509
to 805
a 6799
real 47
strong 16
attachment 3
Pray 9
how 27
was 93
Mr 5
love 29
I 4330
never 3
saw 24
a 6799
more 11
inclination 3
he 962
was 93
inattentive 4
to 805
other 5
people 4
and 51
by 57
her 181
Every 10
time 45
they 5
met 180
it 67
was 93
more 11
and 51
remarkable 3
At 272
his 43
own 9
ball 77
he 962
two 14
or 333
three 12
young 9
by 57
not 85
them 9
to 805
dance 7
and 51
I 4330
spoke 14
to 805
him 9
an 970
answer 8
there 21
be 1200
finer 3
Is 124
not 85
general 22
the 193
essence 3
of 109
love 29
Oh 17
yes 16
of 109
that 11
kind 31
of 109
love 29
I 4330
suppose 4
him 9
to 805
have 11
felt 5
Poor 11
Jane 8
I 4330
am 392
for 484
her 181
with 34
her 181
disposition 3
she 199
may 49
not 85
get 13
over 596
it 67
It 67
had 11
better 7
have 11
to 805
you 29
you 29
would 5
have 11
out 365
of 109
it 67
But 82
do 814
you 29
think 8
she 199
would 5
be 1200
to 805
go 500
back 182
with 34
us 70
Change 21
of 109
scene 5
might 9
be 1200
of 109
service 13
and 51
a 6799
little 6
relief 3
home 90
may 49
be 1200
as 509
useful 4
as 509
anything 3
Elizabeth 5
was 93
with 34
this 6
proposal 3
and 51
felt 5
of 109
her 181
I 4330
hope 16
that 11
no 896
consideration 3
with 34
regard 7
to 805
this 6
young 9
man 342
will 39
influence 4
her 181
We 444
live 43
in 2719
so 797
different 11
a 6799
part 102
of 109
town 27
all 162
our 3
are 12
so 797
different 11
and 51
as 509
you 29
well 24
know 12
we 444
go 500
out 365
so 797
little 6
that 11
it 67
is 124
that 11
they 5
should 7
meet 9
at 272
all 162
he 962
comes 4
to 805
see 70
her 181
And 51
that 11
is 124
for 484
he 962
is 124
now 10
in 2719
the 193
of 109
his 43
friend 14
and 51
Mr 5
would 5
no 896
more 11
suffer 11
him 9
to 805
call 57
on 86
Jane 8
in 2719
a 6799
part 102
of 109
London 5
My 90
dear 15
aunt 6
how 27
you 29
think 8
of 109
it 67
Mr 5
may 49
have 11
of 109
a 6799
place 29
as 509
Street 15
but 82
he 962
would 5
think 8
a 6799
ablution 3
to 805
cleanse 6
him 9
were 5
he 962
to 805
enter 23
it 67
and 51
depend 17
it 67
Mr 5
never 3
him 9
So 797
the 193
better 7
I 4330
hope 16
they 5
will 39
not 85
meet 9
at 272
all 162
But 82
does 5
not 85
Jane 8
correspond 11
with 34
his 43
sister 9
She 199
will 39
not 85
be 1200
able 3
to 805
help 23
calling 3
She 199
will 39
drop 22
the 193
acquaintance 5
But 82
in 2719
spite 10
of 109
the 193
in 2719
Elizabeth 5
to 805
place 29
this 6
point 22
as 509
well 24
as 509
the 193
still 13
more 11
one 19
of 109
being 3
Jane 8
she 199
felt 5
a 6799
on 86
the 193
subject 11
her 181
on 86
examination 3
that 11
she 199
did 23
not 85
consider 13
it 67
hopeless 4
It 67
was 93
possible 3
and 51
she 199
thought 11
it 67
probable 3
that 11
his 43
affection 5
might 9
be 1200
and 51
the 193
influence 4
of 109
his 43
friends 4
by 57
the 193
more 11
natural 18
influence 4
of 109
Miss 71
her 181
invitation 6
with 34
pleasure 5
and 51
the 193
were 5
no 896

the 193
same 5
time 45

in 2719
the 193
same 5
house 87
with 34
her 181
brother 9
she 199
might 9
spend 11
a 6799
morning 3
with 34
her 181
any 17
danger 7
of 109
him 9
The 193

sister 9
that 11
they 5
did 23
not 85
sit 29
down 90
to 805

When 6

You 29

a 6799
girl 14
to 805

love 29
you 29

I 4330

I 4330
have 11
nothing 5

him 9
he 962
is 124
a 6799
most 3
young 9
man 342

the 193

he 962
to 805
have 11
I 4330
should 7
think 8
you 29
not 85
do 814
better 7
But 82
as 509
it 67

you 29

not 85
let 50
your 4
fancy 5
run 50

you 29
You 29

we 444
all 162
expect 20
you 29

Well 24

the 193
most 3
agreeable 3
man 342
I 4330
ever 33
saw 24
and 51
if 8
he 962
to 805
me 1041
I 4330
believe 6
it 67
will 39
be 1200
better 7
that 11
he 962
should 7
not 85
I 4330

Oh 17

to 805

it 67
My 90

to 805
Mr 5
In 2719
short 62
my 90
dear 15
aunt 6
I 4330
should 7
be 1200
to 805
be 1200
the 193
of 109
making 4
any 17
of 109
you 29

how 27
can 287
I 4330
promise 4
to 805
be 1200

so 797
of 109
my 90
fellow 9
if 8
I 4330

or 333
how 27
am 392
I 4330
even 36
to 805
know 12
that 11
it 67
would 5
be 1200
to 805
resist 17
All 162
that 11
I 4330
can 287
promise 4
you 29
is 124
not 85
to 805
be 1200
in 2719
a 6799
hurry 3
I 4330

believe 6
his 43

When 6
I 4330
am 392
in 2719
with 34
him 9
I 4330
will 39
not 85
be 1200
In 2719

I 4330
will 39
do 814
my 90
best 37
it 67
will 39
be 1200
as 509
well 24
if 8
you 29
discourage 6
his 43
coming 3
here 31
so 797
often 4
At 272
least 3
you 29
should 7
not 85
remind 7
your 4
mother 21
of 109
him 9
As 509
I 4330
did 23

Elizabeth 5
with 34
a 6799
conscious 5
smile 7

be 1200
wise 17
in 2719
me 1041

that 11
But 82
do 814
not 85
imagine 3
that 11

It 67
is 124
on 86
your 4

You 29

her 181
friends 4
But 82
and 51
my 90
I 4330
will 39
try 12
to 805
do 814
what 14
I 4330
think 8
to 805
be 1200
the 193
and 51
now 10
I 4330
hope 16
you 29

Her 181

no 896
great 12
inconvenience 4
to 805
His 43
marriage 6
was 93
now 10
fast 29
and 51
she 199
was 93
at 272
length 14
so 797
far 91
as 509
to 805
think 8

and 51
even 36
to 805
say 7
in 2719
an 970
ill 84
tone 12
that 11

appear 7
but 82
the 193

yet 4
more 11
the 193
alteration 3
of 109
her 181
manner 8
would 5
allow 9
Jane 8
to 805
deceive 6
no 896
The 193
letter 20
she 199
on 86
this 6
occasion 7
to 805
her 181
sister 9
will 39
prove 21
what 14
she 199
felt 5
My 90
will 39
I 4330
am 392
sure 11
be 1200
of 109
in 2719
her 181
better 7
at 272
my 90
expense 3
when 6
I 4330
confess 14
to 805
have 11
in 2719
Miss 71
regard 7
for 484
me 1041
But 82
my 90
dear 15
sister 9
though 12
the 193
event 18
has 41
you 29
right 31
do 814
not 85
think 8
me 1041
if 8
I 4330
still 13
assert 11
that 11
what 14
her 181
was 93
my 90
confidence 3
was 93
as 509
natural 18
as 509
your 4
suspicion 3
I 4330
do 814
not 85
at 272
all 162
comprehend 4
her 181
reason 13
for 484
to 805
be 1200
intimate 5
with 34
me 1041
but 82
if 8
the 193
same 5
were 5
to 805
happen 9
I 4330
am 392
sure 11
I 4330
should 7
be 1200
did 23
not 85
return 14
my 90
visit 14
till 14
yesterday 3
and 51
not 85
a 6799
note 16
not 85
a 6799
line 36
did 23
I 4330
receive 8
in 2719
the 193
When 6
she 199
did 23
come 36
it 67
was 93
that 11
she 199
had 11
no 896
pleasure 5
in 2719
it 67
she 199
made 13
a 6799
slight 10
formal 21
for 484
not 85
calling 3
not 85
a 6799
word 26
of 109
to 805
see 70
me 1041
and 51
was 93
in 2719
every 10
respect 18
so 797
a 6799
creature 3
that 11
when 6
she 199
I 4330
was 93
to 805
continue 3
the 193
acquaintance 5
no 896
I 4330
pity 4
though 12
I 4330
help 23
her 181
She 199
was 93
wrong 24
in 2719
me 1041
out 365
as 509
she 199
did 23
I 4330
can 287
say 7
that 11
every 10
advance 7
to 805
on 86
her 181
side 74
But 82
I 4330
pity 4
her 181
she 199
must 28
feel 11
that 11
she 199
has 41
wrong 24
and 51
I 4330
am 392
sure 11
that 11
for 484
her 181
brother 9
is 124
the 193
cause 14
of 109
it 67
I 4330
need 29
not 85
explain 5
and 51
though 12
we 444
know 12
this 6
to 805
be 1200
needless 4
yet 4
if 8
she 199
it 67
it 67
will 39
account 14
for 484
her 181
to 805
me 1041
and 51
so 797
dear 15
as 509
he 962
is 124
to 805
his 43
sister 9
she 199
must 28
feel 11
on 86
his 43
is 124
natural 18
and 51
I 4330
but 82
wonder 17
at 272
her 181
any 17
now 10
if 8
he 962
had 11
at 272
all 162
me 1041
we 444
must 28
have 11
met 180
long 49
ago 15
He 962
of 109
my 90
being 3
in 2719
town 27
I 4330
am 392
certain 5
something 3
she 199
and 51
yet 4
it 67
would 5
seem 10
by 57
her 181
manner 8
of 109
as 509
if 8
she 199
to 805
persuade 6
that 11
he 962
is 124
partial 6
to 805
Miss 71
I 4330
understand 8
it 67
If 8
I 4330
were 5
not 85
of 109
I 4330
should 7
be 1200
to 805
say 7
that 11
there 21
is 124
a 6799
strong 16
appearance 3
of 109
in 2719
all 162
this 6
But 82
I 4330
will 39
to 805
banish 6
every 10
painful 6
thought 11
and 51
think 8
of 109
what 14
will 39
make 17
me 1041
your 4
affection 5
and 51
the 193
invariable 3
kindness 3
of 109
my 90
dear 15
uncle 18
and 51
aunt 6
Let 50
me 1041
hear 76
you 29
soon 3
Miss 71
something 3
of 109
his 43
never 3
to 805
of 109
up 194
the 193
house 87
but 82
not 85
with 34
any 17
We 444
had 11
better 7
not 85
mention 5
it 67
I 4330
am 392
glad 30
that 11
you 29
have 11
pleasant 9
our 3
friends 4
at 272
Pray 9
go 500
to 805
see 70
them 9
with 34
Sir 22
William 3
and 51
Maria 12
I 4330
am 392
sure 11
you 29
will 39
be 1200
comfortable 3
there 21
Yours 3
etc 10
This 6
letter 20
gave 4
Elizabeth 5
some 30
pain 42
but 82
her 181
as 509
she 199
that 11
Jane 8
would 5
no 896
be 1200
by 57
the 193
sister 9
at 272
least 3
All 162
expectation 3
the 193
brother 9
was 93
now 10
over 596
She 199
would 5
not 85
even 36
wish 13
for 484
a 6799
renewal 3
of 109
his 43
His 43
character 16
sunk 4
on 86
every 10
review 8
of 109
it 67
and 51
as 509
a 6799
punishment 3
for 484
him 9
as 509
well 24
as 509
a 6799
possible 3
advantage 6
to 805
Jane 8
she 199
he 962
might 9
soon 3
Mr 5
sister 9
as 509
by 57
account 14
she 199
would 5
make 17
him 9
regret 9
what 14
he 962
had 11
this 6
time 45
Elizabeth 5
of 109
her 181
promise 4
that 11
gentleman 3
and 51
information 3
and 51
Elizabeth 5
had 11
to 805
send 10
as 509
might 9
give 15
to 805
her 181
aunt 6
than 22
to 805
His 43
had 11
his 43
were 5
over 596
he 962
was 93
the 193
admirer 3
of 109
some 30
one 19
Elizabeth 5
was 93
watchful 4
to 805
see 70
it 67
all 162
but 82
she 199
see 70
it 67
and 51
write 5
of 109
it 67
material 17
pain 42
Her 181
heart 57
had 11
but 82
and 51
her 181
was 93
with 34
that 11
she 199
would 5
have 11
his 43
choice 5
had 11
fortune 8
it 67
The 193
sudden 4
acquisition 3
of 109
ten 151
thousand 7
was 93
the 193
most 3
remarkable 3
charm 14
of 109
the 193
young 9
lady 18
to 805
whom 3
he 962
was 93
now 10
rendering 3
agreeable 3
but 82
Elizabeth 5
less 19
clear 23
in 2719
this 6
case 25
than 22
in 2719
did 23
not 85
quarrel 11
with 34
him 9
for 484
his 43
wish 13
of 109
Nothing 5
on 86
the 193
be 1200
more 11
natural 18
and 51
while 4
able 3
to 805
suppose 4
that 11
it 67
cost 32
him 9
a 6799
few 6
to 805
relinquish 6
her 181
she 199
was 93
to 805
allow 9
it 67
a 6799
wise 17
and 51
desirable 3
measure 8
for 484
both 8
and 51
wish 13
him 9
All 162
this 6
was 93
to 805
and 51
after 48
the 193
she 199
on 86
I 4330
am 392
now 10
my 90
dear 15
aunt 6
that 11
I 4330
have 11
never 3
in 2719
love 29
for 484
had 11
I 4330
that 11
pure 14
and 51
passion 9
I 4330
should 7
at 272
present 20
detest 8
his 43
name 17
and 51
wish 13
him 9
all 162
manner 8
of 109
evil 15
But 82
my 90
are 12
not 85
cordial 6
him 9

who 79

Stupid 9

And 51

That 11
is 124
strange 8
But 82
I 4330
suppose 4
you 29
had 11
no 896
Your 4
mother 21
should 7
have 11
you 29
to 805
town 27
every 10
spring 23
for 484
the 193
benefit 5
of 109
masters 4
My 90
mother 21
would 5
have 11
had 11
no 896
objection 5
but 82
my 90
father 12
London 5
Has 41
your 4
governess 3
left 19
you 29
We 444
never 3
had 11
any 17
governess 3
No 896
governess 3
How 27
was 93
that 11
possible 3
Five 5
up 194
at 272
home 90
a 6799
governess 3
I 4330
never 3
of 109
a 6799
thing 15
Your 4
mother 21
must 28
have 11
a 6799
slave 14
to 805
your 4
education 9
Elizabeth 5
help 23
as 509
she 199
assured 4
her 181
that 11
had 11
not 85
the 193
case 25
Then 5
who 79
you 29
who 79
to 805
you 29
a 6799
governess 3
you 29
must 28
have 11
with 34
some 30
I 4330
believe 6
we 444
were 5
but 82
of 109
us 70
as 509
to 805
learn 9
never 3
the 193
We 444
were 5
to 805
read 49
and 51
had 11
all 162
the 193
masters 4
that 11
were 5
who 79
to 805
be 1200
idle 10
might 9
Aye 4
no 896
doubt 15
but 82
that 11
is 124
what 14
a 6799
governess 3
will 39
prevent 13
and 51
if 8
I 4330
had 11
your 4
mother 21
I 4330
should 7
have 11
her 181
most 3
to 805
engage 6
one 19
I 4330
say 7
that 11
nothing 5
is 124
to 805
be 1200
done 3
in 2719
education 9
steady 3
and 51
regular 13
instruction 4
and 51
but 82
a 6799
governess 3
can 287
give 15
it 67
It 67
is 124
wonderful 4
how 27
I 4330
have 11
the 193
of 109
in 2719
that 11
way 27
I 4330
am 392
glad 30
to 805
get 13
a 6799
young 9
person 33
well 24
out 365
Four 26
of 109
are 12
most 3
through 4
my 90
and 51
it 67
was 93
but 82
the 193
other 5
day 27
that 11
I 4330
young 9
person 33
who 79
was 93
to 805
me 1041
and 51
the 193
are 12
with 34
her 181
did 23
I 4330
tell 16
you 29
of 109
Lady 18
calling 3
yesterday 3
to 805
thank 15
me 1041
She 199
Miss 71
Pope 5
a 6799
treasure 7
she 199
have 11
given 3
me 1041
a 6799
treasure 7
Are 12
any 17
of 109
your 4
out 365
Miss 71
Yes 16
all 162
All 162
What 14
all 162
five 5
out 365
at 272
odd 17
And 51
you 29
the 193
second 16
The 193
out 365
the 193
elder 7
are 12
married 3
Your 4
must 28
be 1200
young 9
Yes 16
my 90
is 124
not 85
sixteen 6
she 199
is 124
full 16
young 9
to 805
be 1200
in 2719
But 82
I 4330
think 8
it 67
would 5
be 1200
hard 70
that 11
they 5
should 7
not 85
have 11
share 22
of 109
and 51
amusement 3
the 193
elder 7
may 49
not 85
have 11
the 193
or 333
inclination 3
to 805
The 193
last 7
born 4
has 41
as 509
good 28
a 6799
right 31
to 805
the 193
of 109
youth 7
as 509
the 193
first 8
And 51
to 805
be 1200
back 182
on 86
a 6799
motive 4
I 4330
think 8
it 67
would 5
not 85
be 1200
to 805
promote 6
affection 5
or 333
of 109
mind 25
my 90
word 26
her 181

you 29
give 15
your 4

for 484
so 797
young 9
a 6799
person 33
Pray 9
what 14
is 124
your 4
age 24
With 34
three 12
grown 4
up 194
Elizabeth 5
your 4
ladyship 3
can 287
expect 20
me 1041
to 805
own 9
it 67
Lady 18
at 272
not 85
a 6799
direct 30
answer 8
and 51
Elizabeth 5
to 805
be 1200
the 193
first 8
creature 3
who 79
had 11
ever 33
dared 6
to 805
trifle 7
with 34
so 797
impertinence 3
You 29
be 1200
more 11
than 22
I 4330
am 392
sure 11
you 29
need 29
not 85
conceal 10
your 4
age 24
I 4330
am 392
not 85
one 19

character 16
in 2719
a 6799
part 102
of 109
the 193
world 12

I 4330
had 11

Colonel 5

You 29

something 3
dreadful 4
The 193
first 8
time 45
of 109
my 90

he 962
did 23
He 962
four 26
though 12
were 5
scarce 6
and 51
to 805
my 90
certain 5
knowledge 4
more 11
than 22
one 19
young 9
lady 18
was 93
sitting 3
down 90
in 2719
want 13
of 109
a 6799
partner 8
Mr 5
you 29
the 193
fact 35
I 4330
had 11
not 85
at 272
that 11
time 45
the 193
of 109
knowing 3
any 17
lady 18
in 2719
the 193
assembly 8
my 90
own 9
party 3
True 9
and 51
can 287
ever 33
be 1200
in 2719
a 6799
ball 77
room 22
Well 24
Colonel 5
what 14
do 814
I 4330
play 73
My 90
wait 19
your 4
I 4330
should 7
have 11
better 7
had 11
I 4330
an 970
introduction 3
but 82
I 4330
am 392
ill 84
to 805
recommend 8
to 805
Shall 12
we 444
ask 6
your 4
cousin 3
the 193
reason 13
of 109
this 6
Elizabeth 5
still 13
Colonel 5
Shall 12
we 444
ask 6
him 9
why 4
a 6799
man 342
of 109
sense 8
and 51
education 9
and 51
who 79
has 41
in 2719
the 193
world 12
is 124
ill 84
to 805
recommend 8
to 805
I 4330
can 287
answer 8
your 4
question 16
to 805
him 9
It 67
is 124
he 962
will 39
not 85
give 15
the 193
trouble 18
I 4330
have 11
not 85
the 193
talent 4
some 30
people 4
possess 16
of 109
with 34
I 4330
have 11
never 3
I 4330
catch 24
tone 12
of 109
conversation 8
or 333
appear 7
in 2719
as 509
I 4330
often 4
see 70
done 3
My 90
Elizabeth 5
do 814
not 85
move 10
over 596
this 6
instrument 16
in 2719
the 193
manner 8
I 4330
see 70
so 797
do 814
They 5
have 11
not 85
the 193
same 5
force 10
or 333
and 51
do 814
not 85
produce 7
the 193
same 5
expression 11
But 82
then 5
I 4330
have 11
it 67
to 805
be 1200
my 90
own 9
fault 20
I 4330
will 39
not 85
take 18
the 193
trouble 18
of 109
It 67
is 124
not 85
that 11
I 4330
do 814
not 85
believe 6
my 90
as 509
as 509
any 17
other 5
of 109
superior 5
execution 6
and 51
You 29
are 12
right 31
You 29
have 11
your 4
time 45
better 7
No 896
one 19
to 805
the 193
privilege 4
of 109
hearing 3
you 29
can 287
think 8
anything 3
We 444
of 109
us 70
perform 10
to 805
Here 31
they 5
were 5
by 57
Lady 18
who 79
out 365
to 805
know 12
what 14
they 5
were 5
of 109
Elizabeth 5
Lady 18
and 51
after 48
for 484
a 6799
few 6
to 805
Miss 71
would 5
not 85
play 73
at 272
all 162
if 8
she 199
more 11
and 51
have 11
the 193
advantage 6
of 109
a 6799
London 5
master 28
She 199
has 41
a 6799
good 28
notion 5
of 109
fingering 3
though 12
her 181
taste 15
is 124
not 85
equal 17
to 805
Anne 18
would 5
have 11
a 6799
performer 3
had 11
her 181
health 12
her 181
to 805
learn 9
Elizabeth 5
at 272
to 805
see 70
how 27
he 962
to 805
his 43
praise 7
but 82
at 272
that 11
moment 14
nor 102
at 272
any 17
other 5
she 199
discern 9
any 17
symptom 5
of 109
love 29
and 51
the 193
whole 26
of 109
his 43
to 805
Miss 71
de 2452
she 199
this 6
comfort 14
for 484
Miss 71
that 11
he 962
might 9
have 11
just 24
as 509
to 805
her 181
had 11
she 199
his 43
relation 7
Lady 18
her 181
on 86
performance 3
with 34
them 9
on 86
execution 6
and 51
taste 15
Elizabeth 5
them 9
with 34
all 162
the 193
of 109
and 51
at 272
the 193
request 6
of 109
the 193
at 272
the 193
instrument 16
till 14
her 181
carriage 5
was 93
to 805
take 18
them 9
all 162
home 90
Chapter 3
Elizabeth 5
was 93
sitting 3
by 57
the 193
morning 3
and 51
writing 3
to 805
Jane 8
while 4
and 51
Maria 12
were 5
gone 4
on 86
business 13
into 26
the 193
village 6
when 6
she 199
was 93
by 57
a 6799
ring 30
at 272
the 193
door 41
the 193
certain 5
signal 18
of 109
a 6799
visitor 3
As 509
she 199
had 11
no 896
carriage 5
she 199
thought 11
it 67
not 85
to 805
be 1200
Lady 18
and 51
under 288
that 11
apprehension 3
was 93
her 181
half 23
letter 20
that 11
she 199
might 9
escape 10
all 162
when 6
the 193
door 41
and 51
to 805
her 181
great 12
surprise 4
Mr 5
and 51
Mr 5
the 193
room 22
He 962
too 50
on 86
finding 4
her 181
and 51
for 484
his 43
intrusion 3
by 57
her 181
know 12
that 11
he 962
had 11
all 162
the 193
were 5
to 805
be 1200
within 3
They 5
then 5
sat 92
down 90
and 51
when 6
her 181
after 48
were 5
made 13
in 2719
danger 7
of 109
into 26
total 17
silence 7
It 67
was 93
to 805
think 8
of 109
something 3
and 51
in 2719
this 6
when 6
she 199
had 11
him 9
last 7
in 2719
and 51
feeling 4
curious 4
to 805
know 12
what 14
he 962
would 5
say 7
on 86
the 193
subject 11
of 109
departure 3
she 199
How 27
you 29
all 162
last 7
November 3
Mr 5
It 67
must 28
have 11
a 6799
most 3
agreeable 3
surprise 4
to 805
Mr 5
to 805
see 70
you 29
all 162
after 48
him 9
so 797
soon 3
for 484
if 8
I 4330
recollect 7
right 31
he 962
but 82
the 193
day 27
He 962
and 51
his 43
were 5
well 24
I 4330
hope 16
when 6
you 29
left 19
London 5
so 797
I 4330
thank 15
you 29
She 199
found 18
that 11
she 199
was 93
to 805
receive 8
no 896
other 5
answer 8
and 51
after 48
a 6799
short 62
pause 4
I 4330
think 8
I 4330
have 11
that 11
Mr 5
has 41
not 85
idea 21
of 109
ever 33
to 805
I 4330
have 11
never 3
him 9
say 7
so 797
but 82
it 67
is 124
probable 3
that 11
he 962
may 49
spend 11
little 6
of 109
his 43
time 45
there 21
in 2719
the 193
future 3
He 962
has 41
friends 4
and 51
is 124
at 272
a 6799
time 45
of 109
life 44
when 6
friends 4
and 51
are 12
If 8
he 962
to 805
be 1200
but 82
little 6
at 272
it 67
would 5
be 1200
better 7
for 484
the 193
that 11
he 962
should 7
give 15
up 194
the 193
place 29
for 484
then 5
we 444
might 9
get 13
a 6799
there 21
But 82
Mr 5
did 23
not 85
take 18
the 193
house 87
so 797
for 484
the 193
convenience 3
of 109
the 193
as 509
for 484
his 43
own 9
and 51
we 444
must 28
expect 20
him 9
to 805
keep 11
it 67
or 333
quit 14
it 67
on 86
the 193
same 5
principle 4
I 4330
should 7
not 85
be 1200
if 8
he 962
were 5
to 805
give 15
it 67
up 194
as 509
soon 3
as 509
any 17
purchase 7
Elizabeth 5
made 13
no 896
answer 8
She 199
was 93
of 109
of 109
his 43
friend 14
and 51
nothing 5
to 805
say 7
was 93
now 10
to 805
leave 14
the 193
trouble 18
of 109
finding 4
a 6799
subject 11
to 805
him 9
He 962
the 193
hint 13
and 51
soon 3
with 34
This 6
a 6799
comfortable 3
house 87
Lady 18
I 4330
believe 6
did 23
a 6799
great 12
deal 13
to 805
it 67
when 6
Mr 5
first 8
came 36
to 805
I 4330
believe 6
she 199
did 23
and 51
I 4330
am 392
sure 11
she 199
not 85
have 11
her 181
kindness 3
on 86
a 6799
more 11
grateful 4
object 26
Mr 5
to 805
be 1200
in 2719
his 43
choice 5
of 109
a 6799
wife 6
Yes 16
his 43
friends 4
may 49
well 24
rejoice 3
in 2719
his 43
met 180
with 34
one 19
of 109
the 193
few 6
sensible 3
women 5
who 79
would 5
have 11
him 9
or 333
have 11
made 13
him 9
if 8
they 5
had 11
My 90
friend 14
has 41
an 970
understanding 4
though 12
I 4330
am 392
not 85
certain 5
that 11
I 4330
consider 13
her 181
Mr 5
as 509
the 193
thing 15
she 199
ever 33
did 23
She 199
and 51
in 2719
a 6799
prudential 3
light 42
it 67
is 124
a 6799
good 28
match 25
for 484
her 181
It 67
must 28
be 1200
agreeable 3
for 484
her 181
to 805
be 1200
within 3
so 797
a 6799
distance 4
of 109
her 181
own 9
and 51
friends 4
An 970
distance 4
do 814
you 29
call 57
it 67
It 67
is 124
miles 4
And 51
what 14
is 124
miles 4
of 109
good 28
road 38
Little 6
more 11
than 22
half 23
a 6799
journey 11
Yes 16
I 4330
call 57
it 67
a 6799
distance 4
I 4330
should 7
never 3
have 11
the 193
distance 4
as 509
one 19
of 109
the 193
of 109
the 193
match 25
Elizabeth 5
I 4330
should 7
never 3
have 11
was 93
near 15
her 181
It 67
is 124
a 6799
proof 11
of 109
your 4
own 9
attachment 3
to 805
Anything 3
the 193
of 109
I 4330
suppose 4
would 5
appear 7
far 91
As 509
he 962
spoke 14
there 21
was 93
a 6799
sort 14
of 109
smile 7
Elizabeth 5
she 199
he 962
must 28
be 1200
her 181
to 805
be 1200
of 109
Jane 8
and 51
and 51
she 199
as 509
she 199
I 4330
do 814
not 85
mean 36
to 805
say 7
that 11
a 6799
woman 21
may 49
not 85
be 1200
too 50
near 15
her 181
The 193
far 91
and 51
the 193
near 15
must 28
be 1200
relative 4
and 51
depend 17
on 86
Where 21
there 21
is 124
fortune 8
to 805
make 17
the 193
of 109
distance 4
no 896
evil 15
But 82
that 11
is 124
not 85
the 193
case 25
here 31
Mr 5
and 51
have 11
a 6799
comfortable 3
income 5
but 82
not 85
a 6799

the 193

had 11
his 43
on 86
Miss 71
and 51
after 48
sitting 3
a 6799
few 6
saying 3
to 805
What 14
can 287
be 1200
the 193
meaning 11
of 109
this 6
Charlotte 4
as 509
soon 3
as 509
he 962
was 93
gone 4
My 90
dear 15
Eliza 7
he 962
must 28
be 1200
in 2719
love 29
with 34
you 29
or 333
he 962
would 5
never 3
have 11
us 70
in 2719
this 6
familiar 12
way 27
But 82
when 6
Elizabeth 5
of 109
his 43
silence 7
it 67
did 23
not 85
seem 10
even 36
to 805
to 805
be 1200
the 193
case 25
and 51
after 48
they 5
at 272
last 7
suppose 4
his 43
visit 14
to 805
proceed 7
the 193
of 109
finding 4
anything 3
to 805
do 814
was 93
the 193
more 11
probable 3
the 193
time 45
of 109
year 19
All 162
field 15
sports 24
were 5
over 596
Within 3
doors 9
there 21
was 93
Lady 18

in 2719

the 193

or 333
the 193
of 109
the 193
walk 25
to 805
it 67
or 333
of 109
the 193
people 4
who 79
in 2719
it 67
the 193
two 14
found 18
a 6799
temptation 3
this 6
period 16
of 109
every 10
day 27
They 5
at 272
times 10
of 109
the 193
morning 3
together 3
and 51
now 10
and 51
then 5
by 57
aunt 6
It 67
was 93
plain 27
to 805
them 9
all 162
that 11
Colonel 5
came 36
he 962
had 11
pleasure 5
in 2719
a 6799
persuasion 3
of 109
course 10
him 9
still 13
more 11
and 51
Elizabeth 5
was 93
by 57
her 181
own 9
satisfaction 3
in 2719
being 3
with 34
him 9
as 509
well 24
as 509
by 57
his 43
of 109
her 181
of 109
her 181
former 3
George 6
and 51
though 12
in 2719
them 9
she 199
saw 24
there 21
was 93
less 19
in 2719
Colonel 5
she 199
he 962
might 9
have 11
the 193
best 37
mind 25
But 82
why 4
Mr 5
came 36
so 797
often 4
to 805
the 193
Parsonage 3
it 67
was 93
more 11
difficult 5
to 805
understand 8
It 67
not 85
be 1200
for 484
as 509
he 962
sat 92
there 21
ten 151
together 3
opening 3
his 43
lips 8
and 51
when 6
he 962
did 23
speak 12
it 67
the 193
effect 15
of 109
than 22
of 109
choice 5
a 6799
sacrifice 4
to 805
not 85
a 6799
pleasure 5
to 805
He 962
not 85
what 14
to 805
make 17
of 109
him 9
Colonel 5
laughing 6
at 272
his 43
that 11
he 962
was 93
different 11
her 181
own 9
knowledge 4
of 109
him 9
not 85
have 11
her 181
and 51
as 509
she 199
would 5
to 805
have 11
this 6
change 21
the 193
effect 15
of 109
love 29
and 51
the 193
object 26
of 109
that 11
love 29
her 181
friend 14
Eliza 7
she 199
set 40
to 805
work 87
to 805
find 10
it 67
out 365
She 199
him 9
they 5
were 5
at 272
and 51
he 962
came 36
to 805
but 82
success 13
He 962
at 272
her 181
friend 14
a 6799
great 12
deal 13
but 82
the 193
expression 11
of 109
that 11
look 14
was 93
It 67
was 93
an 970
earnest 8
steadfast 4
gaze 21
but 82
she 199
often 4
there 21
were 5
in 2719
it 67
and 51
it 67
nothing 5
but 82
absence 3
of 109
mind 25
She 199
had 11
or 333
to 805
Elizabeth 5
the 193
of 109
his 43
being 3
partial 6
to 805
her 181
but 82
Elizabeth 5
at 272
the 193
idea 21
and 51
did 23
not 85
think 8
it 67
right 31
to 805
press 30
the 193
subject 11
the 193
danger 7
of 109
might 9
end 92
in 2719
disappointment 3
for 484
in 2719
her 181
opinion 4
it 67
not 85
of 109
a 6799
doubt 15
that 11
all 162
her 181
dislike 4
would 5
vanish 5
if 8
she 199
suppose 4
him 9
to 805
be 1200
in 2719
her 181
power 19
In 2719
her 181
kind 31
for 484
Elizabeth 5
she 199
her 181
Colonel 5
He 962
was 93
comparison 3
the 193
most 3
pleasant 9
man 342
he 962
her 181
and 51
his 43
situation 3
in 2719
life 44
was 93
most 3
but 82
to 805
counterbalance 4
these 4
Mr 5
had 11
patronage 3
in 2719
the 193
church 21
and 51
his 43
cousin 3
have 11
none 32
at 272
all 162
Chapter 3
More 11
than 22
did 23
Elizabeth 5
in 2719
her 181
ramble 7
within 3
the 193
park 18
meet 9
Mr 5
She 199
felt 5
all 162
the 193
of 109
the 193
mischance 3
that 11
should 7
bring 6
him 9
where 21
no 896
one 19
was 93
and 51
to 805
prevent 13
ever 33
happening 3
care 47
to 805
inform 21
him 9
at 272
first 8
that 11
it 67
was 93
a 6799
haunt 9
of 109
hers 9
How 27
it 67
occur 7
a 6799
second 16
time 45
was 93
odd 17
Yet 4
it 67
did 23
and 51
even 36
a 6799
third 4
It 67
like 22
ill 84
nature 3
or 333
a 6799
penance 3
for 484
on 86
these 4
it 67
was 93
not 85
a 6799
few 6
formal 21
and 51
an 970
awkward 6
pause 4
and 51
then 5
but 82
he 962
thought 11
it 67
to 805
turn 46
back 182
and 51
walk 25
with 34
her 181
He 962
never 3
a 6799
great 12
deal 13
nor 102
did 23
she 199
give 15
the 193
trouble 18
of 109
or 333
of 109
but 82
it 67
her 181
in 2719
the 193
course 10
of 109
third 4
that 11
he 962
was 93
some 30
odd 17
her 181
pleasure 5
in 2719
being 3
at 272
her 181
love 29
of 109
and 51
her 181
opinion 4
of 109
Mr 5
and 51
and 51
that 11
in 2719
of 109
and 51
her 181
not 85
understanding 4
the 193
house 87
he 962
to 805
expect 20
that 11
she 199
came 36
into 26
Kent 9
she 199
would 5
be 1200
there 21
too 50
His 43
words 5
to 805
it 67
he 962
have 11
Colonel 5
in 2719
his 43
She 199
if 8
he 962
meant 3
anything 3
he 962
must 28
mean 36
an 970
allusion 3
to 805
what 14
might 9
arise 3
in 2719
that 11
quarter 25
It 67
her 181
a 6799
little 6
and 51
she 199
was 93
glad 30
to 805
find 10
at 272
the 193
gate 25
in 2719
the 193
pales 8
opposite 4
the 193
Parsonage 3
She 199
was 93
one 19
day 27
as 509
she 199
in 2719
last 7
letter 20
and 51
dwelling 3
on 86
some 30
that 11
Jane 8
had 11
not 85
in 2719
when 6
of 109
being 3
by 57
Mr 5
she 199
saw 24
on 86
up 194
that 11
Colonel 5
was 93
meeting 6
her 181
the 193
letter 20
and 51
a 6799
smile 7
she 199
I 4330
did 23
not 85
know 12
that 11
you 29
ever 33
this 6
way 27
I 4330
have 11
making 4
the 193
tour 23
of 109
the 193
park 18
he 962
as 509
I 4330
do 814
every 10
year 19
and 51
intend 6
to 805
close 22
it 67
with 34
a 6799
call 57
at 272
the 193
Parsonage 3
Are 12
you 29
going 3
No 896
I 4330
should 7
have 11
in 2719
a 6799
moment 14
And 51
she 199
did 23
turn 46
and 51
they 5
the 193
Parsonage 3
together 3
Do 814
you 29
leave 14
Kent 9
on 86
Saturday 3
she 199
Yes 16
if 8
does 5
not 85
put 47
it 67
off 100
But 82
I 4330
am 392
at 272
his 43
disposal 3
He 962
the 193
business 13
just 24
as 509
he 962
And 51
if 8
not 85
able 3
to 805
please 3
in 2719
the 193
arrangement 3
he 962
has 41
at 272
least 3
pleasure 5
in 2719
the 193
great 12
power 19
of 109
choice 5
I 4330
do 814
not 85
know 12
who 79
more 11
to 805
enjoy 9
the 193
power 19
of 109
doing 3
what 14
he 962
than 22
Mr 5
He 962
to 805
have 11
his 43
own 9
way 27
well 24
Colonel 5
But 82
so 797
we 444
all 162
do 814
It 67
is 124
that 11
he 962
has 41
better 7
of 109
it 67
than 22
he 962
is 124
rich 19
and 51
are 12
poor 11
I 4330
speak 12
A 6799
son 70
you 29
know 12
must 28
be 1200
to 805
self 11
denial 3
and 51
In 2719
my 90
opinion 4
the 193
son 70
of 109
an 970
earl 20
can 287
know 12
little 6
of 109
Now 10
what 14
have 11
you 29
ever 33
of 109
self 11
denial 3
and 51
When 6
have 11
you 29
by 57
want 13
of 109
money 17
going 3
you 29
or 333
anything 3
you 29
had 11
a 6799
fancy 5
for 484
These 4
are 12
home 90
and 51
I 4330
say 7
that 11
I 4330
have 11
of 109
that 11
nature 3
But 82
in 2719
of 109
weight 21
I 4330
may 49
suffer 11
want 13
of 109
money 17
where 21
they 5
like 22
where 21
they 5
like 22
women 5
of 109
fortune 8
I 4330
think 8
they 5
often 4
do 814
Our 3
of 109
expense 3
make 17
us 70
too 50
dependent 4
and 51
there 21
are 12
not 85
in 2719
my 90
rank 19
of 109
life 44
who 79
can 287
afford 6
to 805
some 30
attention 3
to 805
money 17
Is 124
this 6
thought 11
Elizabeth 5
meant 3
for 484
me 1041
and 51
she 199
at 272
the 193
idea 21
but 82
in 2719
a 6799
tone 12
And 51
pray 9
what 14
is 124
the 193
usual 3
price 6
of 109
an 970
son 70
the 193
elder 7
brother 9
is 124
I 4330
suppose 4
you 29
would 5
not 85
ask 6
above 3
thousand 7
He 962
her 181
in 2719
the 193
same 5
style 4
and 51
the 193
subject 11
To 805
interrupt 11
a 6799
silence 7
might 9
make 17
him 9
fancy 5
her 181
with 34
what 14
had 11
she 199
soon 3
I 4330
imagine 3
your 4
cousin 3
you 29
down 90
with 34
him 9
for 484
the 193
of 109
someone 3
at 272
his 43
disposal 3
I 4330
wonder 17
he 962
does 5
not 85
to 805
secure 6
a 6799

No 896
Colonel 5

Does 5

Young 9

her 181
age 24
are 12
a 6799
little 6
difficult 5
to 805
manage 15
and 51
if 8
she 199

the 193
true 9

she 199
may 49
like 22

the 193

near 15
the 193
truth 7
She 199
You 29

not 85
be 1200
I 4330
never 3
any 17
harm 41
of 109
her 181
and 51
I 4330
dare 15
say 7
she 199
is 124
one 19
of 109
the 193
most 3
in 2719
the 193
world 12
She 199
is 124
a 6799
great 12
with 34
some 30
of 109
my 90
acquaintance 5

Miss 71

think 8
I 4330
have 11
you 29

that 11

them 9
I 4330

a 6799
little 6
brother 9

a 6799
pleasant 9
man 342

is 124
a 6799
great 12
friend 14
of 109
Oh 17
yes 16
Elizabeth 5
Mr 5

Mr 5
and 51
a 6799
deal 13
of 109
care 47
of 109
him 9
Care 47
of 109
him 9
Yes 16
I 4330
believe 6
does 5
take 18
care 47
of 109
him 9
in 2719
where 21
he 962
most 3
care 47
something 3
that 11
he 962
me 1041
in 2719
our 3
journey 11
I 4330
have 11
reason 13
to 805
think 8
indebted 3
to 805
him 9
But 82
I 4330
to 805
beg 59
his 43
pardon 10
for 484
I 4330
have 11
no 896
right 31
to 805
suppose 4
that 11
was 93
the 193
person 33
meant 3
It 67
was 93
all 162
conjecture 4
What 14
is 124
it 67
you 29
mean 36
It 67
is 124
a 6799
circumstance 4

if 8
it 67
were 5
to 805
get 13
round 29
to 805
the 193
it 67
would 5
be 1200
an 970
unpleasant 4
thing 15
You 29
may 49
depend 17
my 90
not 85
it 67
And 51
remember 4
that 11
I 4330
have 11
not 85
reason 13
for 484
it 67
to 805
be 1200
What 14
he 962
me 1041
was 93
this 6
that 11
he 962
on 86
a 6799
friend 14

a 6799
most 3
marriage 6
but 82
names 4
or 333
any 17
other 5
and 51
I 4330
it 67
to 805
be 1200
him 9
the 193
kind 31
of 109
young 9
man 342
to 805
get 13
into 26
a 6799
scrape 7
of 109
that 11
sort 14
and 51
knowing 3
them 9
to 805
have 11
together 3
the 193
whole 26
of 109
last 7
summer 13
Did 23
Mr 5

you 29
for 484
this 6
I 4330
that 11
there 21
were 5
some 30
strong 16
the 193
lady 18
And 51
what 14
arts 4
did 23
he 962
use 18
to 805
separate 7
them 9
He 962
did 23
not 85
talk 18
to 805
me 1041
of 109
his 43
own 9
arts 4
He 962
me 1041
what 14
I 4330
have 11
now 10
you 29
Elizabeth 5
made 13
no 896
answer 8
and 51
on 86
her 181
heart 57
swelling 3
with 34
After 48
her 181
a 6799
little 6
her 181
why 4
she 199
was 93
so 797
thoughtful 4
I 4330
am 392
of 109
what 14
you 29
have 11
me 1041
she 199
Your 4
conduct 21
does 5
not 85
suit 21
my 90
Why 4
was 93
he 962
to 805
be 1200
the 193
judge 6
You 29
are 12
to 805
call 57
his 43
officious 4
I 4330
do 814
not 85
see 70
what 14
right 31
Mr 5
had 11
to 805
decide 6
on 86
the 193
of 109
his 43
inclination 3
or 333
why 4
his 43
own 9
he 962
was 93
to 805
determine 7
and 51
direct 30
in 2719
what 14
manner 8
his 43
friend 14
was 93
to 805
be 1200
But 82
she 199
as 509
we 444
know 12
none 32
of 109
the 193
it 67
is 124
not 85
fair 25
to 805
condemn 11
him 9
It 67
is 124
not 85
to 805
be 1200
that 11
there 21
was 93
affection 5
in 2719
the 193
case 25
That 11
is 124
not 85
an 970
unnatural 4
surmise 4
but 82
it 67
is 124
a 6799
of 109
the 193
of 109
my 90
triumph 10
This 6
was 93
but 82
it 67
to 805
her 181
so 797
just 24
a 6799
picture 8
of 109
Mr 5
that 11
she 199
would 5
not 85
trust 26
with 34
an 970
answer 8
and 51
the 193
conversation 8
on 86
they 5
the 193
Parsonage 3
There 21
shut 32
into 26
her 181
own 9
room 22
as 509
soon 3
as 509
visitor 3
left 19
them 9
she 199
think 8
interruption 3
of 109
all 162
that 11
she 199
had 11
It 67
was 93
not 85
to 805
be 1200
that 11
any 17
other 5
people 4
be 1200
meant 3
than 22
with 34
whom 3
she 199
was 93
There 21
not 85
exist 15
in 2719
the 193
world 12
two 14
men 140
over 596
whom 3
Mr 5
have 11
boundless 4
influence 4
That 11
he 962
had 11
in 2719
the 193
to 805
separate 7
and 51
Jane 8
she 199
had 11
never 3
but 82
she 199
had 11
to 805
Miss 71
the 193
principal 7
design 16
and 51
arrangement 3
of 109
them 9
If 8
his 43
own 9
did 23
not 85
mislead 4
him 9
he 962
was 93
the 193
cause 14
his 43
pride 6
and 51
caprice 3
were 5
the 193
cause 14
of 109
all 162
that 11
Jane 8
had 11
and 51
still 13
to 805
suffer 11
He 962
had 11
for 484
a 6799
while 4
every 10
hope 16
of 109
for 484
the 193
most 3
generous 4

how 27
an 970
evil 15
he 962
might 9
have 11
There 21
were 5

country 12
attorney 3
and 51
who 79
was 93

London 5
To 805
Jane 8

no 896
of 109
objection 5
all 162

Mr 5
need 29
not 85

When 6
she 199
thought 11
of 109
her 181
mother 21
her 181
confidence 3
gave 4
way 27
a 6799
little 6
but 82
she 199

had 11
material 17
weight 21
with 34
Mr 5

the 193
want 13
of 109
in 2719
his 43
than 22
want 13
of 109
sense 8
and 51
she 199
was 93
at 272
last 7
that 11
he 962
had 11
by 57
this 6
worst 6
kind 31
of 109
pride 6

When 6

exasperate 4
as 509
as 509

Mr 5
for 484
her 181
employment 3
the 193
examination 3
of 109
all 162
the 193
Jane 8
had 11
to 805
her 181
since 7
her 181
being 3
in 2719
Kent 9
They 5
no 896
actual 11
complaint 3
nor 102
was 93
there 21
any 17
revival 8
of 109
past 71
or 333
any 17
communication 3
of 109

suffering 3
But 82
in 2719
all 162
and 51
in 2719
every 10
line 36
of 109
there 21
was 93
a 6799
want 13
of 109
that 11
had 11
to 805
her 181
style 4
and 51
proceeding 3
the 193
of 109
a 6799
mind 25
at 272
ease 10
with 34
and 51
had 11
ever 33
Elizabeth 5
every 10

the 193
idea 21

an 970
attention 3

on 86
the 193
first 8

Mr 5
shameful 4
boast 12
of 109
what 14
he 962
had 11
able 3
to 805
inflict 7
gave 4
her 181
a 6799
sense 8
of 109
her 181
It 67
was 93
some 30
consolation 3
to 805
think 8
that 11
his 43
visit 14
to 805
was 93
to 805
end 92
on 86
the 193
day 27
after 48
the 193
and 51
a 6799
still 13
that 11
in 2719
less 19
than 22
a 6799
fortnight 4
she 199
should 7
be 1200
with 34
Jane 8
and 51
to 805
contribute 3
to 805
the 193
of 109
her 181
by 57
all 162
that 11
affection 5
do 814
She 199
not 85
think 8
of 109
leaving 3
Kent 9
that 11
his 43
cousin 3
was 93
to 805
go 500
with 34
him 9
but 82
Colonel 5
had 11
made 13
it 67
clear 23
that 11
he 962
had 11
no 896
at 272
all 162
and 51
agreeable 3
as 509
he 962
was 93
she 199
did 23
not 85
mean 36
to 805
be 1200
him 9
While 4
this 6
point 22
she 199
was 93
by 57
the 193
sound 29
of 109
the 193
door 41
bell 66
and 51
her 181
were 5
a 6799
little 6
by 57
the 193
idea 21
of 109
being 3
Colonel 5
who 79
had 11
late 23
in 2719
the 193
evening 3
and 51
might 9
now 10
come 36
to 805
inquire 6
after 48
her 181
But 82
this 6
idea 21
was 93
soon 3
and 51
her 181
were 5
when 6
to 805
her 181
utter 10
she 199
saw 24
Mr 5
walk 25
into 26
the 193
room 22
In 2719
an 970
manner 8
he 962
an 970
after 48
her 181
health 12
his 43
visit 14
to 805
a 6799
wish 13
of 109
hearing 3
that 11
she 199
were 5
better 7
She 199
him 9
with 34
cold 9
He 962
sat 92
down 90
for 484
a 6799
few 6
and 51
then 5
up 194
the 193
room 22
Elizabeth 5
was 93
but 82

After 48
a 6799
silence 7
of 109
several 3
he 962
came 36
her 181
in 2719
an 970
manner 8
and 51
In 2719
vain 8
I 4330
have 11
It 67
will 39
not 85
do 814
My 90
will 39

You 29
must 28
allow 9
me 1041
to 805
tell 16
you 29
how 27
I 4330
admire 6
and 51
love 29

expression 11
She 199
and 51
was 93
silent 6
This 6
he 962
encouragement 3
and 51
the 193
avowal 3
of 109
all 162
that 11
he 962
felt 5
and 51
had 11
long 49
felt 5
for 484
her 181
He 962
spoke 14
well 24
but 82
there 21
were 5
of 109
the 193
heart 57
to 805
be 1200
and 51
he 962
was 93
not 85
more 11
on 86
the 193
subject 11
of 109
than 22
of 109
pride 6
His 43
sense 8
of 109
her 181
of 109
being 3
a 6799
of 109
the 193
had 11

inclination 3
were 5
on 86
with 34
a 6799
due 21
to 805
the 193
consequence 3
he 962
was 93
but 82
was 93
to 805
recommend 8
his 43
suit 21
In 2719
spite 10
of 109
her 181
dislike 4
she 199
not 85
be 1200
to 805
the 193
compliment 6
of 109
a 6799
affection 5
and 51
though 12
her 181
did 23
not 85
for 484
an 970
instant 11
she 199
was 93
at 272
first 8
for 484
the 193
pain 42
he 962
was 93
to 805
receive 8
till 14
to 805
resentment 3
by 57
his 43
language 3
she 199
all 162
compassion 4
in 2719
anger 5
She 199
to 805
compose 7
to 805
answer 8
him 9
with 34
when 6
he 962
should 7
have 11
done 3
He 962
with 34
to 805
her 181
the 193
strength 10
of 109
that 11
attachment 3
in 2719
spite 10
of 109
all 162
his 43
he 962
had 11
found 18
to 805
conquer 8
and 51
with 34
his 43
hope 16
that 11
it 67
would 5
now 10
be 1200
by 57
her 181
acceptance 3
of 109
his 43
hand 137
As 509
he 962
this 6
she 199
see 70
that 11
he 962
had 11
no 896
doubt 15
of 109
a 6799
answer 8
He 962
spoke 14
of 109
apprehension 3
and 51
but 82
his 43
countenance 4
real 47
a 6799
circumstance 4
exasperate 4
and 51
when 6
he 962
the 193
rose 37
into 26
her 181
and 51
she 199
In 2719
as 509
this 6
it 67
is 124
I 4330
believe 6
the 193
mode 57
to 805
express 25
a 6799
sense 8
of 109
obligation 3
for 484
the 193
they 5
may 49
be 1200
It 67
is 124
natural 18
that 11
obligation 3
should 7
be 1200
felt 5
and 51
if 8
I 4330
feel 11
I 4330
would 5
now 10
thank 15
you 29
But 82
I 4330
I 4330
have 11
never 3
your 4
good 28
opinion 4
and 51
you 29
have 11
it 67
most 3
I 4330
am 392
to 805
have 11
pain 42
to 805
It 67
has 41
most 3
done 3
and 51
I 4330
hope 16
will 39
be 1200
of 109
short 62
The 193
you 29
tell 16
me 1041
have 11
long 49
the 193
acknowledgment 3
of 109
your 4
regard 7
can 287
have 11
little 6
in 2719
it 67
after 48
this 6
explanation 3
Mr 5
who 79
was 93
leaning 3
the 193
mantelpiece 3
with 34
his 43
eyes 8
on 86
her 181
face 19
to 805
catch 24
her 181
words 5
with 34
no 896
less 19
resentment 3
than 22
surprise 4
His 43
complexion 5
pale 41
with 34
anger 5
and 51
the 193
disturbance 3
of 109
his 43
mind 25
was 93
in 2719
every 10
feature 5
He 962
was 93
for 484
the 193
appearance 3
of 109
and 51
would 5
not 85
open 21
his 43
lips 8
till 14
he 962
to 805
have 11
it 67
The 193
pause 4
was 93
to 805
dreadful 4
At 272
length 14
with 34
a 6799
voice 8
of 109
he 962
And 51
this 6
is 124
all 162
the 193
reply 3
I 4330
am 392
to 805
have 11
the 193
of 109
I 4330
might 9
wish 13
to 805
be 1200
why 4
with 34
so 797
little 6
at 272
I 4330
am 392
But 82
it 67
is 124
of 109
small 14
I 4330
might 9
as 509
well 24
inquire 6
she 199
why 4
with 34
so 797
a 6799
desire 6
of 109
and 51
me 1041
you 29
to 805
tell 16
me 1041
that 11
you 29
me 1041
your 4
will 39
your 4
reason 13
and 51
even 36
your 4
character 16
Was 93
not 85
this 6
some 30
excuse 4
for 484
if 8
I 4330
was 93
uncivil 3
But 82
I 4330
have 11
other 5
You 29
know 12
I 4330
have 11
Had 11
not 85
my 90
you 29
had 11
they 5
or 333
had 11
they 5
even 36
do 814
you 29
think 8
that 11
any 17
consideration 3
would 5
tempt 14
me 1041
to 805
accept 16
the 193
man 342
who 79
has 41
the 193
of 109
for 484
ever 33
the 193
of 109
a 6799
most 3
beloved 3
sister 9
As 509
she 199
these 4
words 5
Mr 5
but 82
the 193
emotion 12
was 93
short 62
and 51
he 962
to 805
interrupt 11
her 181
while 4
she 199
I 4330
have 11
every 10
reason 13
in 2719
the 193
world 12
to 805
think 8
ill 84
of 109
you 29
No 896
motive 4
can 287
excuse 4
the 193
unjust 5
and 51
part 102
you 29
there 21
You 29
dare 15
not 85
you 29
that 11
you 29
have 11
the 193
principal 7
if 8
not 85
the 193
of 109
them 9
other 5
of 109
one 19
to 805
the 193
censure 7
of 109
the 193
world 12
for 484
caprice 3
and 51
and 51
the 193
other 5
to 805
for 484
and 51
them 9
both 8
in 2719
of 109
the 193
kind 31
She 199
and 51
saw 24
with 34
no 896
slight 10
that 11
he 962
was 93
with 34
an 970
air 129
him 9
by 57
any 17
feeling 4
of 109
remorse 8
He 962
even 36
at 272
her 181
with 34
a 6799
smile 7
of 109
Can 287
you 29
that 11
you 29
have 11
done 3
it 67
she 199
With 34
he 962
then 5
I 4330
have 11
no 896
wish 13
of 109
that 11
I 4330
did 23
in 2719
my 90
power 19
to 805
separate 7
my 90
friend 14
your 4
sister 9
or 333
that 11
I 4330
rejoice 3
in 2719
my 90
success 13
him 9
I 4330
have 11
kinder 7
than 22
Elizabeth 5
the 193
appearance 3
of 109
this 6
civil 15
reflection 3
but 82
meaning 11
did 23
not 85
escape 10
nor 102
was 93
it 67
to 805
conciliate 3
her 181
But 82
it 67
is 124
not 85
this 6
affair 3
she 199
on 86
my 90
dislike 4
is 124
Long 49
it 67
had 11
place 29
my 90
opinion 4
of 109
you 29
was 93
Your 4
character 16
was 93
in 2719
the 193
recital 6
I 4330
ago 15
Mr 5
On 86
this 6
subject 11
what 14
can 287
you 29
have 11
to 805
say 7
In 2719
what 14
act 69
of 109
friendship 3
can 287
you 29
here 31
defend 10
or 333
under 288
what 14
misrepresentation 3
can 287
you 29
here 31
impose 6
You 29
take 18
an 970
eager 6
interest 6
in 2719
that 11
in 2719
a 6799
less 19
tranquil 13
tone 12
and 51
with 34
a 6799
Who 79
that 11
what 14
his 43
have 11
can 287
help 23
feeling 4
an 970
interest 6
in 2719
him 9
His 43
yes 16
his 43

great 12
And 51
of 109
your 4
Elizabeth 5
with 34
You 29
have 11
him 9
to 805
his 43
present 20
state 41
of 109
comparative 4
You 29
have 11
the 193
you 29
must 28
know 12
to 805
have 11
for 484
him 9
You 29
have 11
the 193
best 37
of 109
his 43
life 44
of 109
that 11
was 93
no 896
less 19
his 43
due 21
than 22
his 43
desert 12
You 29
have 11
done 3
all 162
this 6
and 51
yet 4
you 29
can 287
treat 15
the 193
mention 5
of 109
his 43
misfortune 3
with 34
contempt 8
and 51
ridicule 4
And 51
this 6
as 509
he 962
with 34
quick 25
steps 7
the 193
room 22
is 124
your 4
opinion 4
of 109
me 1041
This 6
is 124
the 193
estimation 3
in 2719
you 29
hold 22
me 1041
I 4330
thank 15
you 29
for 484
it 67
so 797
My 90
to 805
this 6
calculation 3
are 12
heavy 7
But 82
he 962
in 2719
his 43
walk 25
and 51
turning 3
her 181
these 4
might 9
have 11
had 11
not 85
your 4
pride 6
hurt 12
by 57
my 90
honest 6
confession 6
of 109
the 193
that 11
had 11
long 49
my 90
any 17
serious 4
design 16
These 4
bitter 15
might 9
have 11
had 11
I 4330
with 34
policy 7
my 90
and 51
you 29
into 26
the 193
belief 3
of 109
my 90
being 3
by 57
inclination 3
by 57
reason 13
by 57
reflection 3
by 57
But 82
disguise 4
of 109
every 10
sort 14
is 124
my 90
Nor 102
am 392
I 4330
of 109
the 193
I 4330
related 3
They 5
were 5
natural 18
and 51
just 24
you 29
expect 20
me 1041
to 805
rejoice 3
in 2719
the 193
of 109
your 4

on 86
the 193
hope 16
of 109
relations 4
condition 13
in 2719
life 44
is 124
so 797
my 90
own 9
Elizabeth 5
felt 5
more 11
every 10
moment 14
yet 4
she 199
to 805
the 193
to 805
speak 12
with 34
when 6
she 199
You 29
are 12
Mr 5
if 8
you 29
suppose 4
that 11
the 193
mode 57
of 109
your 4
declaration 3

in 2719
any 17
other 5
way 27

have 11
felt 5
in 2719
you 29
had 11
you 29
in 2719
a 6799
more 11
manner 8
She 199
saw 24
him 9
start 13
at 272
this 6
but 82
he 962
nothing 5
and 51
she 199
You 29
not 85
have 11
made 13
the 193
offer 10
of 109
your 4
hand 137
in 2719
any 17
possible 3
way 27
that 11
would 5
have 11
me 1041
to 805
accept 16
it 67
his 43

obvious 4
and 51
he 962
at 272
her 181
with 34
an 970
expression 11
of 109
and 51
She 199
on 86
the 193
beginning 3
the 193
first 8
moment 14
I 4330
may 49
say 7
of 109
my 90
acquaintance 5
with 34
you 29
your 4
me 1041
with 34
the 193
belief 3
of 109
your 4
your 4
conceit 7
and 51
your 4
selfish 4
disdain 7
of 109
the 193

were 5
as 509
to 805
form 68
the 193
of 109
on 86

so 797
a 6799
dislike 4
and 51
I 4330

month 6
I 4330
felt 5
that 11

the 193
last 7
man 342
in 2719
the 193
world 12

You 29

comprehend 4
your 4
and 51
have 11
now 10
to 805
be 1200
of 109
what 14
my 90
own 9
have 11
Forgive 8
me 1041
for 484
up 194
so 797
of 109
your 4
time 45
and 51
accept 16
my 90
best 37
for 484
your 4
health 12
and 51
And 51
with 34
these 4
words 5

the 193

quit 14
the 193
house 87
The 193
tumult 5
of 109
her 181
mind 25
was 93
now 10
great 12
She 199
not 85
how 27
to 805
support 10
and 51
actual 11
weakness 3
sat 92
down 90
and 51
for 484
half 23
an 970
hour 10
Her 181
as 509
she 199
on 86
what 14
had 11
was 93
by 57
every 10
review 8
of 109
it 67
That 11
she 199
should 7
receive 8
an 970
offer 10
of 109
marriage 6
Mr 5
That 11
he 962
should 7
have 11
in 2719
love 29
with 34
her 181
for 484
so 797
So 797
in 2719
love 29
as 509
to 805
wish 13
to 805
her 181
in 2719
spite 10
of 109
all 162
the 193

made 13
him 9
prevent 13
his 43
her 181

with 34
equal 17
force 10
in 2719
his 43
own 9
case 25
was 93
It 67
was 93
to 805
have 11
so 797
strong 16
an 970
affection 5
But 82
his 43
pride 6
his 43
pride 6
his 43
shameless 4
avowal 3
of 109
what 14
he 962
had 11
done 3
with 34
respect 18
to 805
Jane 8
his 43
assurance 3
in 2719
though 12
he 962
not 85
it 67

had 11
Mr 5
his 43

he 962

not 85
to 805
soon 3
the 193
pity 4
the 193
consideration 3
of 109
his 43
attachment 3
had 11
for 484
a 6799
moment 14
She 199
in 2719
till 14
the 193
sound 29
of 109
Lady 18
carriage 5
made 13
her 181
feel 11
how 27
unequal 3
she 199

She 199

the 193
surprise 4
of 109
what 14

of 109
anything 3

She 199

at 272
the 193

The 193

had 11
made 13
a 6799
great 12
difference 3
in 2719

the 193

you 29
Will 39
you 29
do 814
me 1041
the 193
of 109
reading 3
that 11
letter 20
And 51
then 5
with 34
a 6799
slight 10
bow 58

out 365
of 109
sight 17
With 34

The 193
envelope 7
was 93

renewal 3
of 109

formation 3

should 7
have 11
had 11

my 90
character 16
it 67
to 805
be 1200
and 51
read 49
You 29
must 28
pardon 10
the 193
freedom 3
with 34
I 4330
demand 5
your 4
attention 3
your 4
I 4330
know 12
will 39
bestow 7
it 67
but 82
I 4330
demand 5
it 67
of 109
your 4
justice 3
Two 14
of 109
a 6799
different 11
nature 3
and 51
by 57
no 896
of 109
equal 17
magnitude 3
you 29
last 7
night 61
to 805
my 90
charge 8
The 193
first 8
was 93
that 11
of 109
the 193
of 109
I 4330
had 11
Mr 5
your 4
sister 9
and 51
the 193
other 5
that 11
I 4330
had 11
in 2719
of 109
in 2719
of 109
and 51
the 193
immediate 4
and 51
the 193
of 109
Mr 5
and 51
to 805
have 11
off 100
the 193
companion 10
of 109
my 90
youth 7
the 193
of 109
my 90
father 12
a 6799
young 9
man 342
who 79
had 11
any 17
other 5
than 22
on 86
our 3
patronage 3
and 51
who 79
had 11
up 194
to 805
expect 20
exertion 3
would 5
be 1200
a 6799
to 805
the 193
separation 3
of 109
two 14
young 9
affection 5
be 1200
the 193
growth 3
of 109
a 6799
few 6
bear 30
no 896
comparison 3
But 82
the 193
of 109
that 11
blame 12
was 93
last 7
night 61
so 797
circumstance 4
I 4330
shall 12
hope 16
to 805
be 1200
in 2719
the 193
future 3
when 6
the 193
following 3
account 14
of 109
my 90
and 51
has 41
read 49
If 8
in 2719
the 193
explanation 3
of 109
them 9
is 124
due 21
to 805
I 4330
am 392
under 288
the 193
of 109
may 49
be 1200
offensive 6
to 805
yours 3
I 4330
can 287
say 7
that 11
I 4330
am 392
The 193
must 28
be 1200
and 51
further 8
would 5
be 1200
absurd 9
I 4330
had 11
not 85
long 49
in 2719
I 4330
saw 24
in 2719
common 23
with 34
that 11
your 4
elder 7
sister 9
to 805
any 17
other 5
young 9
woman 21
in 2719
the 193
country 12
But 82
it 67
was 93
not 85
till 14
the 193
evening 3
of 109
the 193
dance 7
at 272
that 11
I 4330
had 11
any 17
apprehension 3
of 109
his 43
feeling 4
a 6799
serious 4
attachment 3
I 4330
had 11
often 4
him 9
in 2719
love 29
At 272
that 11
ball 77
while 4
I 4330
had 11
the 193
of 109
with 34
you 29
I 4330
was 93
first 8
made 13
by 57
Sir 22
William 3
accidental 4
information 3
that 11
to 805
your 4
sister 9
had 11
given 3
rise 7
to 805
a 6799
general 22
expectation 3
of 109
marriage 6
He 962
spoke 14
of 109
it 67
as 509
a 6799
certain 5
event 18
of 109
the 193
time 45
be 1200
undecided 3
that 11
moment 14
I 4330
my 90
and 51
I 4330
then 5
perceive 3
that 11
his 43
for 484
Miss 71
was 93
what 14
I 4330
had 11
ever 33
in 2719
him 9
Your 4
sister 9
I 4330
also 3
Her 181
look 14
and 51
were 5
open 21
cheerful 6
and 51
as 509
ever 33
but 82
any 17
symptom 5
of 109
peculiar 5
regard 7
and 51
I 4330
the 193
that 11
though 12
she 199
his 43
with 34
pleasure 5
she 199
did 23
not 85
invite 7
them 9
by 57
any 17
of 109
sentiment 18
If 8
you 29
have 11
not 85
here 31
I 4330
must 28
have 11
in 2719
error 3
Your 4
superior 5
knowledge 4
of 109
your 4
sister 9
must 28
make 17
the 193
latter 3
probable 3
If 8
it 67
be 1200
so 797
if 8
I 4330
have 11
by 57
error 3
to 805
inflict 7
pain 42
on 86
her 181
your 4
resentment 3
has 41
not 85
unreasonable 3
But 82
I 4330
shall 12
not 85
scruple 4
to 805
assert 11
that 11
the 193
of 109
your 4
countenance 4
and 51
air 129
was 93
as 509
might 9
have 11
given 3
the 193
most 3
acute 8
observer 3
a 6799
conviction 3
that 11
her 181
temper 22
her 181
heart 57
was 93
not 85
to 805
be 1200
That 11
I 4330
was 93
of 109
her 181
is 124
certain 5
but 82
I 4330
will 39
venture 8
to 805
say 7
that 11
my 90
investigation 3
and 51
are 12
not 85
by 57
my 90
or 333
I 4330
did 23
not 85
believe 6
her 181
to 805
be 1200
I 4330
it 67
I 4330
it 67
on 86
impartial 4
conviction 3
as 509
as 509
I 4330
it 67
in 2719
reason 13
My 90
to 805
the 193
marriage 6
were 5
not 85
I 4330
last 7
night 61
to 805
have 11
the 193
force 10
of 109
passion 9
to 805
put 47
aside 3
in 2719
my 90
own 9
case 25
the 193
want 13
of 109
connection 3
not 85
be 1200
so 797
great 12
an 970
evil 15
to 805
my 90
friend 14
as 509
to 805
me 1041
But 82
there 21
were 5
other 5
of 109
though 12
still 13
and 51
to 805
an 970
equal 17
degree 3
in 2719
both 8
I 4330
had 11
to 805
forget 8
they 5
were 5
not 85
me 1041
These 4
must 28
be 1200
though 12
The 193
situation 3
of 109
your 4
though 12
was 93
nothing 5
in 2719
comparison 3
to 805
that 11
total 17
want 13
of 109
so 797
so 797
by 57
by 57
your 4
three 12
and 51
even 36
by 57
your 4
father 12
Pardon 10
me 1041
It 67
pains 4
me 1041
to 805
offend 7
you 29
But 82
your 4
concern 6
for 484
the 193
of 109
your 4
relations 4
and 51
your 4
at 272
this 6
representation 4
of 109
them 9
let 50
it 67
give 15
you 29
consolation 3
to 805
consider 13
that 11
to 805
have 11
so 797
as 509
to 805
avoid 8
any 17
share 22
of 109
the 193

censure 7
is 124
praise 7
no 896

on 86
you 29
and 51
your 4
elder 7
sister 9
than 22
it 67
is 124
to 805
the 193
sense 8
and 51
disposition 3
of 109
both 8
I 4330
will 39
say 7
that 11
what 14
that 11
evening 3
my 90
opinion 4
of 109
all 162
was 93
and 51
every 10
inducement 3
have 11
led 11
me 1041
to 805
preserve 7
my 90
friend 14
what 14
I 4330
a 6799
most 3
connection 3
He 962
left 19
for 484
London 5
on 86
the 193
day 27
following 3
as 509
you 29
I 4330
am 392
certain 5
remember 4
with 34
the 193
design 16
of 109
soon 3
The 193
part 102
I 4330
is 124
now 10
to 805
be 1200
His 43
had 11
with 34
my 90
own 9
our 3
coincidence 3
of 109
feeling 4
was 93
soon 3
and 51
sensible 3
that 11
no 896
time 45
was 93
to 805
be 1200
in 2719
brother 9
we 444
on 86
him 9
in 2719
London 5
We 444
and 51
there 21
I 4330
in 2719
the 193
office 11
of 109
out 365
to 805
my 90
friend 14
the 193
certain 5
of 109
a 6799
choice 5
I 4330
and 51
them 9
But 82
this 6
remonstrance 3
might 9
have 11
or 333
his 43
determination 3
I 4330
do 814
not 85
suppose 4
that 11
it 67
would 5
have 11
the 193
marriage 6
had 11
it 67
not 85
by 57
the 193
assurance 3
that 11
I 4330
not 85
in 2719
of 109
your 4
He 962
had 11
her 181
to 805
return 14
his 43
affection 5
with 34
sincere 4
if 8
not 85
with 34
equal 17
regard 7
But 82
has 41
great 12
natural 18
with 34
a 6799
on 86
my 90
than 22
on 86
his 43
own 9
To 805
convince 3
him 9
that 11
he 962
had 11
was 93
no 896
difficult 5
point 22
To 805
persuade 6
him 9
into 26
when 6
that 11
conviction 3
had 11
given 3
was 93
the 193
work 87
of 109
a 6799
moment 14
I 4330
blame 12
for 484
done 3
There 21
is 124
but 82
one 19
part 102
of 109
my 90
conduct 21
in 2719
the 193
whole 26
affair 3
on 86
I 4330
do 814
not 85
reflect 12
with 34
satisfaction 3
it 67
is 124
that 11
I 4330
to 805
adopt 12
the 193
of 109
art 104
so 797
far 91
as 509
to 805
conceal 10
him 9
your 4
being 3
in 2719
town 27
I 4330
it 67
as 509
it 67
was 93
to 805
Miss 71
but 82
her 181
brother 9
is 124
even 36
yet 4
of 109
it 67
That 11
they 5
might 9
have 11
met 180
ill 84
consequence 3
is 124
probable 3
but 82
his 43
regard 7
did 23
not 85
appear 7
to 805
me 1041
for 484
him 9
to 805
see 70
her 181
some 30
danger 7
this 6
this 6
disguise 4
was 93
me 1041
it 67
is 124
done 3
and 51
it 67
was 93
done 3
for 484
the 193
best 37
On 86
this 6
subject 11
I 4330
have 11
nothing 5
more 11
to 805
say 7
no 896
other 5
to 805
offer 10
If 8
I 4330
have 11
your 4
it 67
was 93
done 3
and 51
though 12
the 193
me 1041
may 49
to 805
you 29
appear 7
I 4330
have 11
not 85
yet 4
to 805
condemn 11
them 9
With 34
respect 18
to 805
that 11
other 5
more 11
accusation 3
of 109
Mr 5
I 4330
can 287
refute 6
it 67
by 57
you 29
the 193
whole 26
of 109
his 43
connection 3
with 34
my 90
Of 109
what 14
he 962
has 41
me 1041
I 4330
am 392
but 82
of 109
the 193
truth 7
of 109
what 14
I 4330
shall 12
relate 8
I 4330
can 287
summon 11
more 11
than 22
one 19
witness 5
of 109
Mr 5
is 124
the 193
son 70
of 109
a 6799
man 342
who 79
had 11
for 484
the 193
management 3
of 109
all 162
the 193
and 51
good 28
conduct 21
in 2719
the 193
discharge 4
of 109
his 43
trust 26
my 90
father 12
to 805
be 1200
of 109
service 13
to 805
him 9
and 51
on 86
George 6
who 79
was 93
his 43
godson 3
his 43
kindness 3
was 93
My 90
father 12
him 9
at 272
school 54
and 51
at 272
most 3
as 509
his 43
own 9
father 12
poor 11
the 193
extravagance 3
of 109
his 43
wife 6
would 5
have 11
to 805
give 15
him 9
a 6799
education 9
My 90
father 12
was 93
not 85
fond 17
of 109
this 6
young 9
were 5
he 962
had 11
also 3
the 193
opinion 4
of 109
him 9
and 51
the 193
church 21
would 5
be 1200
his 43
profession 14
intended 3
to 805
provide 13
for 484
him 9
in 2719
it 67
As 509
for 484
it 67
is 124
since 7
I 4330
first 8
to 805
think 8
of 109
him 9
in 2719
a 6799
different 11
manner 8
The 193
vicious 4
the 193
want 13
of 109
principle 4
he 962
was 93
careful 6
to 805
guard 26
the 193
knowledge 4
of 109
his 43
best 37
friend 14
not 85
escape 10
the 193
observation 4
of 109
a 6799
young 9
man 342
of 109
the 193
same 5
age 24
with 34
and 51
who 79
had 11
of 109
him 9
in 2719
Mr 5
not 85
have 11
Here 31
I 4330
shall 12
give 15
you 29
pain 42
to 805
what 14
degree 3
you 29
can 287
tell 16
But 82
may 49
be 1200
the 193
Mr 5
has 41
a 6799
suspicion 3
of 109
nature 3
shall 12
not 85
prevent 13
me 1041
his 43
real 47
character 16
it 67
even 36
motive 4
My 90
father 12
five 5
ago 15
and 51
his 43
attachment 3
to 805
Mr 5
was 93
to 805
the 193
last 7
so 797
steady 3
that 11
in 2719
his 43
will 39
he 962
it 67
to 805
me 1041
to 805
promote 6
his 43
advancement 3
in 2719
the 193
best 37
manner 8
that 11
his 43
profession 14
might 9
allow 9
and 51
if 8
he 962
that 11
a 6799
valuable 3
living 5
might 9
be 1200
his 43
as 509
soon 3
as 509
it 67
There 21
was 93
also 3
a 6799
of 109
one 19
thousand 7
His 43
own 9
father 12
did 23
not 85
long 49
survive 3
mine 26
and 51
within 3
half 23
a 6799
year 19
these 4
Mr 5
to 805
inform 21
me 1041
that 11
taking 4
he 962
I 4330
should 7
not 85
think 8
it 67
unreasonable 3
for 484
him 9
to 805
expect 20
some 30
more 11
immediate 4
advantage 6
in 2719
lieu 8
of 109
the 193
by 57
he 962
not 85
be 1200
He 962
had 11
some 30
intention 5
he 962
of 109
law 45
and 51
I 4330
must 28
be 1200
aware 3
that 11
the 193
interest 6
of 109
one 19
thousand 7
would 5
be 1200
a 6799
support 10
I 4330
than 22
him 9
to 805
be 1200
sincere 4
but 82
at 272
any 17
rate 9
was 93
to 805
accede 3
to 805
his 43
proposal 3
I 4330
that 11
Mr 5
not 85
to 805
be 1200
a 6799
the 193
business 13
was 93
soon 3
he 962
all 162
claim 12
to 805
in 2719
the 193
church 21
were 5
it 67
possible 3
that 11
he 962
ever 33
be 1200
in 2719
a 6799
situation 3
to 805
receive 8
it 67
and 51
in 2719
return 14
three 12
thousand 7
All 162
connection 3
us 70
now 10
I 4330
thought 11
too 50
ill 84
of 109
him 9
to 805
invite 7
him 9
to 805
or 333
admit 7
his 43
in 2719
town 27
In 2719
town 27
I 4330
believe 6
he 962
but 82
his 43
the 193
law 45
was 93
a 6799
mere 10
and 51
being 3
now 10
free 93
all 162
restraint 3
his 43
life 44
was 93
a 6799
life 44
of 109
and 51
For 484
three 12
I 4330
little 6
of 109
him 9
but 82
on 86
the 193
decease 5
of 109
the 193
incumbent 3
of 109
the 193
living 5
had 11
for 484
him 9
he 962
to 805
me 1041
by 57
letter 20
for 484
the 193
presentation 3
His 43
he 962
assured 4
me 1041
and 51
I 4330
had 11
no 896
in 2719
it 67
were 5
bad 33
He 962
had 11
found 18
the 193
law 45
a 6799
most 3
study 3
and 51
was 93
now 10
on 86
being 3
if 8
I 4330
would 5
present 20
him 9
to 805
the 193
living 5
in 2719
question 16
of 109
he 962
there 21
be 1200
little 6
doubt 15
as 509
he 962
was 93
well 24
assured 4
that 11
I 4330
had 11
no 896
other 5
person 33
to 805
provide 13
for 484
and 51
I 4330
not 85
have 11
my 90
You 29
will 39
blame 12
me 1041
for 484
to 805
with 34
this 6
or 333
for 484
every 10
repetition 3
to 805
it 67
His 43
resentment 3
was 93
in 2719
proportion 11
to 805
the 193
distress 7
of 109
his 43
and 51
he 962
was 93
as 509
in 2719
his 43
abuse 7
of 109
me 1041
to 805
as 509
in 2719
his 43
to 805
After 48
this 6
period 16
every 10
appearance 3
of 109
acquaintance 5
was 93
How 27
he 962
I 4330
know 12
not 85
But 82
last 7
summer 13
he 962
was 93
most 3
on 86
my 90
notice 8
I 4330
must 28
now 10
mention 5
a 6799
circumstance 4
I 4330
would 5
wish 13
to 805
forget 8
and 51
no 896
obligation 3
less 19
than 22
the 193
present 20
should 7
induce 9
me 1041
to 805
unfold 4
to 805
any 17
human 41
being 3
I 4330
feel 11
no 896
doubt 15
of 109
your 4
My 90

have 11
a 6799
prior 17
acquaintance 5
him 9
and 51
in 2719
character 16
we 444
were 5
most 3
and 51
by 57
her 181
and 51
aid 12
he 962
so 797
far 91
to 805
heart 57
a 6799
strong 16
impression 12
of 109
his 43
kindness 3
to 805
her 181
as 509
a 6799
child 28
that 11
she 199

consent 5
to 805
an 970
elopement 3
She 199

knowledge 4
of 109

a 6799
day 27
or 333
two 14
the 193
intended 3
elopement 3
and 51
then 5
to 805
support 10
the 193
idea 21
of 109
and 51
a 6799
brother 9
whom 3
she 199
up 194
to 805
as 509
a 6799

the 193
whole 26
to 805
me 1041
You 29
may 49
imagine 3
what 14
I 4330
felt 5
and 51
how 27
I 4330
Regard 7
for 484
my 90
credit 12
and 51
any 17
public 18
exposure 3
but 82
I 4330
to 805
Mr 5

I 4330
help 23
that 11
the 193

This 6

every 10

his 43

Chapter 3
If 8
Elizabeth 5
when 6
Mr 5
gave 4
her 181
the 193
letter 20
did 23
not 85
expect 20
it 67
to 805
contain 16
a 6799
renewal 3
of 109
his 43
she 199
had 11
no 896
expectation 3
at 272
all 162
of 109
But 82
as 509
they 5
were 5
it 67
may 49
well 24
be 1200
how 27
she 199
through 4
them 9
and 51
what 14
a 6799
of 109
emotion 12
they 5
Her 181
as 509
she 199
read 49
were 5
to 805
be 1200
With 34
did 23
she 199
first 8
understand 8
that 11
he 962
any 17
to 805
be 1200
in 2719
his 43
power 19
and 51
was 93
she 199
that 11
he 962
have 11
no 896
explanation 3
to 805
give 15
a 6799
just 24
sense 8
of 109
shame 14
would 5
not 85
conceal 10
With 34
a 6799
strong 16
prejudice 4
he 962
might 9
say 7
she 199
his 43
account 14
of 109
what 14
had 11
at 272
She 199
read 49
with 34
an 970
left 19
her 181
power 19
of 109
comprehension 3
and 51
impatience 3
of 109
knowing 3
what 14
the 193
sentence 4
might 9
bring 6
was 93
of 109
to 805
the 193
sense 8
of 109
the 193
one 19
her 181
eyes 8
His 43
belief 3
of 109
her 181
she 199
to 805
be 1200
false 12
and 51
his 43
account 14
of 109
the 193
real 47
the 193
worst 6
to 805
the 193
match 25
made 13
her 181
too 50
to 805
have 11
any 17
wish 13
of 109
doing 3
him 9
justice 3
He 962
no 896
regret 9
for 484
what 14
he 962
had 11
done 3
her 181
his 43
style 4
was 93
not 85
penitent 8
but 82
It 67
was 93
all 162
pride 6
and 51
But 82
when 6
this 6
subject 11
was 93
by 57
his 43
account 14
of 109
Mr 5
when 6
she 199
read 49
with 34
attention 3
a 6799
relation 7
of 109
if 8
true 9
must 28
overthrow 5
every 10
opinion 4
of 109
his 43
worth 15
and 51
bore 13
so 797
an 970
to 805
his 43
own 9
of 109
her 181
were 5
yet 4
more 11
painful 6
and 51
more 11
difficult 5
of 109
definition 3
apprehension 3
and 51
even 36
horror 3
her 181
She 199
to 805
discredit 7
it 67
This 6
must 28
be 1200
false 12
This 6
be 1200
This 6
must 28
be 1200
the 193
falsehood 3
and 51
when 6
she 199
had 11
gone 4
through 4
the 193
whole 26
letter 20
though 12
knowing 3
anything 3
of 109
the 193
last 7
page 15
or 333
two 14
put 47
it 67
that 11
she 199
would 5
not 85
regard 7
it 67
that 11
she 199
would 5
never 3
look 14
in 2719
it 67
In 2719
this 6
state 41
of 109
mind 25
with 34
that 11
rest 110
on 86
nothing 5
she 199
on 86
but 82
it 67
would 5
not 85
do 814
in 2719
half 23
a 6799
minute 12
the 193
letter 20
was 93
and 51
as 509
well 24
as 509
she 199
she 199
the 193
perusal 3
of 109
all 162
that 11
related 3
to 805
and 51
so 797
far 91
as 509
to 805
examine 6
the 193
meaning 11
of 109
every 10
sentence 4
The 193
account 14
of 109
his 43
connection 3
with 34
the 193
was 93
what 14
he 962
had 11
related 3
and 51
the 193
kindness 3
of 109
the 193
late 23
Mr 5
though 12
she 199
had 11
not 85
extent 3
well 24
with 34
his 43
own 9
words 5
So 797
far 91
recital 6
the 193
other 5
but 82
when 6
she 199
came 36
to 805
the 193
will 39
the 193
difference 3
was 93
great 12
What 14
had 11
of 109
the 193
living 5
was 93
fresh 22
in 2719
her 181
and 51
as 509
she 199
his 43
words 5
it 67
was 93
not 85
to 805
feel 11
that 11
there 21
was 93
gross 10
on 86
one 19
side 74
or 333
the 193
other 5
and 51
for 484
a 6799
few 6
she 199
that 11
her 181
did 23
not 85
err 22
But 82
when 6
she 199
read 49
and 51
re 3833
read 49
with 34
the 193
attention 3
the 193
following 3
of 109
all 162
to 805
the 193
living 5
of 109
his 43
in 2719
lieu 8
so 797
a 6799
sum 70
as 509
three 12
thousand 7
was 93
she 199
to 805
hesitate 3
She 199
put 47
down 90
the 193
letter 20
every 10
circumstance 4
with 34
what 14
she 199
meant 3
to 805
be 1200
on 86
the 193
of 109
statement 5
but 82
with 34
little 6
success 13
On 86
both 8
sides 23
it 67
was 93
assertion 3
she 199
read 49
on 86
but 82
every 10
line 36
more 11
that 11
the 193
affair 3
she 199
had 11
it 67
that 11
any 17
contrivance 3
so 797
represent 11
as 509
to 805
render 7
Mr 5

in 2719
it 67
less 19
than 22
was 93
of 109
a 6799
turn 46
must 28
make 17
him 9
blameless 4
the 193
whole 26
The 193
extravagance 3
and 51
general 22
he 962
not 85
to 805
lay 42
at 272

of 109
injustice 3
She 199

entrance 6
into 26
the 193
shire 3
Militia 6
in 2719

had 11
at 272
the 193
persuasion 3
of 109
the 193
young 9
man 342
who 79
on 86
meeting 6
him 9
in 2719
town 27
had 11
there 21
a 6799
slight 10
acquaintance 5
Of 109
his 43
former 3
way 27
of 109
life 44
nothing 5
had 11
in 2719
but 82
what 14
he 962
As 509
to 805
his 43
real 47
character 16
had 11
information 3
in 2719

power 19
she 199
had 11
never 3
felt 5
a 6799
wish 13
of 109
His 43
countenance 4
voice 8
and 51
manner 8
had 11
him 9
at 272
in 2719
the 193
possession 3
of 109
every 10
virtue 3
She 199
to 805
recollect 7
some 30
instance 4
of 109
some 30
trait 8
of 109
or 333
benevolence 3
that 11
might 9
rescue 7
him 9
the 193
of 109
Mr 5
or 333
at 272

by 57
the 193

virtue 3
atone 5
for 484
casual 9
under 288

would 5
to 805
class 44
what 14
Mr 5
had 11
as 509
the 193
and 51
vice 14
of 109
continuance 3
But 82
no 896

She 199

in 2719
every 10
charm 14
of 109
air 129
and 51
address 9
but 82
she 199
remember 4
no 896
more 11
good 28
than 22
the 193
general 22
approbation 3
of 109
the 193

the 193
regard 7
his 43
social 19

him 9
in 2719
the 193
mess 31
After 48
on 86
this 6
point 22
a 6799
while 4
she 199
more 11
to 805
read 49
But 82
alas 6
the 193
story 13
of 109
his 43
on 86
Miss 71
some 30
confirmation 3
what 14
had 11
Colonel 5
and 51
the 193
morning 3
and 51
at 272
last 7

was 93
for 484
the 193
truth 7
of 109
every 10
particular 13
to 805
Colonel 5
whom 3
she 199
had 11
the 193
information 3
of 109
his 43
near 15
concern 6
in 2719
all 162
his 43
and 51
character 16
she 199
had 11
no 896
reason 13
to 805
question 16
At 272
one 19
time 45
she 199
had 11
on 86
to 805
him 9
but 82
the 193
idea 21
was 93
by 57
the 193
of 109
the 193
application 3
and 51
at 272
length 14
by 57
the 193
conviction 3
that 11
Mr 5
would 5
never 3
have 11
a 6799
proposal 3
if 8
he 962
had 11

assured 4
of 109

She 199

of 109
Mr 5
that 11
Mr 5

How 27

and 51
I 4330
up 194
the 193
blinds 5
and 51
there 21
was 93
in 2719
the 193
coach 11
and 51
I 4330
should 7
have 11
gone 4
so 797
all 162
the 193
way 27
if 8
had 11
not 85
sick 38
and 51
when 6
we 444
got 14
to 805
the 193
George 6
I 4330
do 814
think 8
we 444
for 484
we 444
the 193
other 5
three 12
with 34
the 193
cold 9
luncheon 6
in 2719
the 193
world 12
and 51
if 8
you 29
would 5
have 11
gone 4
we 444
would 5
have 11
you 29
too 50
And 51
then 5
when 6
we 444
came 36
it 67
was 93
fun 88
I 4330
thought 11
we 444
never 3
should 7
have 11
got 14
into 26
the 193
coach 11
I 4330
was 93
to 805
die 38
of 109
And 51
then 5
we 444
were 5
so 797
merry 6
all 162
the 193
way 27
home 90
we 444
and 51
so 797
loud 16
that 11
might 9
have 11
us 70
ten 151
miles 4
off 100
To 805
this 6
Mary 13
Far 91
be 1200
it 67
me 1041
my 90
dear 15
sister 9
to 805
depreciate 3
They 5
would 5
be 1200
congenial 4
with 34
the 193
of 109
female 5
minds 4
But 82
I 4330
confess 14
they 5
would 5
have 11
no 896
for 484
me 1041
I 4330
should 7
prefer 13
a 6799
book 69
But 82
of 109
this 6
answer 8
Lydia 4
not 85
a 6799
word 26
She 199
to 805
for 484
more 11
than 22
half 23
a 6799
minute 12
and 51
never 3
to 805
Mary 13
at 272
all 162
In 2719
the 193
afternoon 3
Lydia 4
was 93
with 34
the 193
rest 110
of 109
the 193
to 805
walk 25
to 805
and 51
to 805
see 70
how 27
on 86
but 82
Elizabeth 5
the 193
scheme 7
It 67
should 7
not 85
be 1200
that 11
the 193
Miss 71
not 85
be 1200
at 272
home 90
half 23
a 6799
day 27
they 5
were 5
in 2719
pursuit 3
of 109
the 193
There 21
was 93
reason 13
too 50
for 484
her 181
opposition 3
She 199
Mr 5
and 51
was 93
to 805
avoid 8
it 67
as 509
long 49
as 509
possible 3
The 193
comfort 14
to 805
her 181
of 109
the 193
removal 3
was 93
expression 11
In 2719
a 6799
fortnight 4
they 5
were 5
to 805
go 500
and 51
gone 4
she 199
there 21
be 1200
nothing 5
more 11
to 805
plague 4
her 181
on 86
his 43
account 14
She 199
had 11
not 85
at 272
home 90
she 199
found 18
that 11
the 193
scheme 7
of 109
Lydia 4
had 11
given 3
them 9
a 6799
hint 13
at 272
the 193
inn 59
was 93
under 288
frequent 9
discussion 3
her 181
Elizabeth 5
saw 24
that 11
her 181
father 12
had 11
not 85
the 193
intention 5
of 109
but 82
his 43
were 5
at 272
the 193
same 5
time 45
so 797
vague 6
and 51
equivocal 4
that 11
her 181
mother 21
though 12
often 4
had 11
never 3
yet 4
of 109
at 272
last 7
Chapter 3
impatience 3
to 805
acquaint 9
Jane 8
with 34
what 14
had 11
no 896
be 1200
and 51
at 272
length 14
to 805
suppress 13
every 10
particular 13
in 2719
her 181
sister 9
was 93
and 51
her 181
to 805
be 1200
she 199
related 3
to 805
her 181
the 193
morning 3
the 193
chief 14
of 109
the 193
scene 5
Mr 5
and 51
Miss 71
was 93
soon 3
by 57
the 193
strong 16
made 13
any 17
of 109
Elizabeth 5
appear 7
natural 18
and 51
all 162
surprise 4
was 93
in 2719
other 5
She 199
was 93
that 11
Mr 5
should 7
have 11
his 43
in 2719
a 6799
manner 8
so 797
little 6
to 805
recommend 8
them 9
but 82
still 13
more 11
was 93
she 199
for 484
the 193
her 181
refusal 3
must 28
have 11
given 3
him 9
His 43
being 3
so 797
sure 11
of 109
was 93
wrong 24
she 199
and 51
not 85
to 805
have 11
but 82
consider 13
how 27
it 67
must 28
increase 4
his 43
disappointment 3
Elizabeth 5
I 4330
am 392
for 484
him 9
but 82
he 962
has 41
other 5
will 39
soon 3
drive 18
his 43
regard 7
for 484
me 1041
You 29
do 814
not 85
blame 12
me 1041
for 484
him 9
Blame 12
you 29
Oh 17
no 896
But 82
you 29
blame 12
me 1041
for 484
so 797
of 109
No 896
I 4330
do 814
not 85
know 12
that 11
you 29
were 5
wrong 24
in 2719
saying 3
what 14
you 29
did 23
But 82
you 29
will 39
know 12
it 67
when 6
I 4330
tell 16
you 29
what 14
the 193
day 27
She 199
then 5
spoke 14
of 109
the 193
letter 20
the 193
whole 26
of 109
as 509
far 91
as 509
they 5
George 6
What 14
a 6799
stroke 4
was 93
this 6
for 484
poor 11
Jane 8
who 79
would 5
have 11
gone 4
through 4
the 193
world 12
that 11
so 797
in 2719
the 193
whole 26
race 24
of 109
as 509
was 93
here 31
in 2719
one 19
individual 19
Nor 102
was 93
vindication 3
though 12
grateful 4
to 805
her 181
of 109
her 181
for 484
Most 3
did 23
she 199
to 805
prove 21
the 193
of 109
error 3
and 51
seek 6
to 805
clear 23
the 193
one 19
the 193
other 5
This 6
will 39
not 85
do 814
Elizabeth 5
you 29
never 3
will 39
be 1200
able 3
to 805
make 17
both 8
of 109
them 9
good 28
for 484
anything 3
Take 18
your 4
choice 5
but 82
you 29
must 28
be 1200
with 34
one 19
There 21
is 124
but 82
a 6799
of 109
merit 13
them 9
just 24
to 805
make 17
one 19
good 28
sort 14
of 109
man 342
and 51
of 109
late 23
it 67
has 41
pretty 3
For 484
my 90
part 102
I 4330
am 392
to 805
believe 6
it 67
all 162
but 82
you 29
shall 12
do 814
as 509
you 29
choose 5
It 67
was 93
some 30
time 45
a 6799
smile 7
be 1200
Jane 8
I 4330
do 814
not 85
know 12
when 6
I 4330
have 11
more 11
she 199
so 797
bad 33
It 67
is 124
past 71
belief 3
And 51
poor 11
Mr 5
Dear 15
consider 13
what 14
he 962
must 28
have 11
a 6799
disappointment 3
and 51
with 34
the 193
knowledge 4
of 109
your 4
ill 84
opinion 4
too 50
and 51
to 805
relate 8
a 6799
thing 15
of 109
his 43
sister 9
It 67
is 124
too 50
I 4330
am 392
sure 11
you 29
must 28
feel 11
it 67
so 797
Oh 17
no 896
my 90
regret 9
and 51
compassion 4
are 12
all 162
done 3
by 57
you 29
so 797
full 16
of 109
both 8
I 4330
know 12
you 29
will 39
do 814
him 9
ample 3
justice 3
that 11
I 4330
am 392
every 10
moment 14
more 11
and 51
Your 4
profusion 3
makes 4
me 1041
saving 4
and 51
if 8
you 29
lament 10
over 596
him 9
my 90
heart 57
will 39
be 1200
as 509
light 42
as 509
a 6799
feather 15
Poor 11
there 21
is 124
an 970
expression 11
of 109
in 2719
his 43
countenance 4
an 970
and 51
in 2719
his 43
manner 8
There 21
was 93
some 30
great 12
in 2719
the 193
education 9
of 109
two 14
young 9
men 140
One 19
has 41
got 14
all 162
the 193
and 51
the 193
other 5
all 162
the 193
appearance 3
of 109
it 67
I 4330
never 3
thought 11
Mr 5
so 797
in 2719
the 193
appearance 3
of 109
it 67
as 509
you 29
to 805
do 814
And 51
yet 4
I 4330
meant 3
to 805
be 1200
clever 6
in 2719
taking 4
so 797
a 6799
dislike 4
to 805
him 9
any 17
reason 13
It 67
is 124
a 6799
spur 20
to 805
genius 3
an 970
opening 3
for 484
wit 77
to 805
have 11
a 6799
dislike 4
of 109
that 11
kind 31
One 19
may 49
be 1200
abusive 4
saying 3
anything 3
just 24
but 82
one 19
be 1200
laughing 6
at 272
a 6799
man 342
now 10
and 51
then 5
on 86
something 3
when 6
you 29
first 8
read 49
that 11
letter 20
I 4330
am 392
sure 11
you 29
not 85
treat 15
the 193
matter 7
as 509
you 29
do 814
now 10
I 4330
not 85
I 4330
was 93
I 4330
may 49
say 7
And 51
with 34
no 896
one 19
to 805
speak 12
to 805
what 14
I 4330
felt 5
no 896
Jane 8
to 805
comfort 14
me 1041
and 51
say 7
that 11
I 4330
had 11
not 85
so 797
weak 20
and 51
vain 8
and 51
as 509
I 4330
I 4330
had 11
Oh 17
how 27
I 4330
you 29
How 27
unfortunate 4
that 11
you 29
should 7
have 11
strong 16
in 2719
of 109
to 805
Mr 5
for 484
now 10
they 5
do 814
appear 7
But 82
the 193
misfortune 3
of 109
with 34
is 124
a 6799
most 3
natural 18
consequence 3
of 109
the 193
I 4330
had 11
There 21
is 124
one 19
point 22
on 86
I 4330
want 13
your 4
I 4330
want 13
to 805
be 1200
I 4330
or 333
not 85
to 805
make 17
our 3
acquaintances 3
in 2719
general 22
understand 8
character 16
Miss 71
a 6799
little 6
and 51
then 5
there 21
can 287
be 1200
no 896
occasion 7
for 484
him 9
so 797
What 14
is 124
your 4
opinion 4
That 11
it 67
not 85
to 805
be 1200
Mr 5
has 41
not 85
me 1041
to 805
make 17
his 43
communication 3
public 18
On 86
the 193
every 10
particular 13
relative 4
to 805
his 43
sister 9
was 93
meant 3
to 805
be 1200
as 509
as 509
possible 3
to 805
and 51
if 8
I 4330
to 805
undeceive 3
people 4
as 509
to 805
the 193
rest 110
of 109
his 43
conduct 21
who 79
will 39
believe 6
me 1041
The 193
general 22
prejudice 4
Mr 5
is 124
so 797
that 11
it 67
would 5
be 1200
the 193
death 19
of 109
half 23
the 193
good 28
people 4
in 2719
to 805
attempt 5
to 805
place 29
him 9
in 2719
an 970
light 42
I 4330
am 392
not 85
equal 17
to 805
it 67
will 39
soon 3
be 1200
gone 4
and 51
it 67
will 39
not 85
to 805
here 31
what 14
he 962
is 124
Some 30
time 45
hence 3
it 67
will 39
be 1200
all 162
found 18
out 365
and 51
then 5
we 444
may 49
laugh 14
at 272
in 2719
not 85
knowing 3
it 67
At 272
present 20
I 4330
will 39
say 7
nothing 5
it 67
You 29
are 12
right 31
To 805
have 11
his 43
made 13
public 18
might 9
ruin 10
him 9
for 484
ever 33
He 962
is 124
now 10
for 484
what 14
he 962
has 41
done 3
and 51
anxious 4
to 805
re 3833
establish 7
a 6799
character 16
We 444
must 28
not 85
make 17
him 9
desperate 4
The 193
tumult 5
of 109
mind 25
was 93
by 57
this 6
conversation 8
She 199
had 11
got 14
rid 42
of 109
two 14
of 109
the 193
had 11
on 86
her 181
for 484
a 6799
fortnight 4
and 51
was 93
certain 5
of 109
a 6799
willing 4
listener 3
in 2719
Jane 8
she 199
might 9
wish 13
to 805
talk 18
of 109
But 82
there 21
was 93
still 13
something 3
behind 4
of 109
the 193
disclosure 3
She 199
dared 6
not 85
relate 8
the 193
other 5
half 23

Mr 5

her 181
sister 9
how 27
she 199

Here 31

she 199
was 93
sensible 3

nothing 5
less 19
than 22
a 6799
perfect 24
understanding 4
the 193
her 181
in 2719
off 100
this 6
last 7
encumbrance 3
of 109
And 51
then 5
she 199
if 8
that 11
event 18
should 7
ever 33
take 18
place 29
I 4330
shall 12
be 1200
able 3
to 805
tell 16
what 14
may 49
tell 16

The 193

She 199

home 90
at 272
leisure 8
to 805
observe 6
the 193
real 47
state 41
of 109
her 181
Jane 8

She 199

affection 5
for 484

and 51
disposition 3
than 22
most 3
first 8
often 4
boast 12
and 51
so 797
did 23
she 199
value 8
his 43
remembrance 3
and 51
prefer 13
him 9
to 805
every 10
other 5
man 342
that 11
all 162
her 181
good 28

all 162
her 181
attention 3
to 805
the 193
of 109
her 181
friends 4
were 5
requisite 3
to 805

the 193
indulgence 3
of 109
must 28

her 181
own 9
health 12
and 51
Well 24
one 19
day 27
what 14
is 124
your 4
opinion 4
now 10
of 109
this 6
sad 47
business 13
of 109
For 484
my 90
part 102
I 4330
am 392
never 3
to 805
speak 12
of 109
it 67
to 805
I 4330
my 90
sister 9
so 797
the 193
other 5
day 27
But 82
I 4330
find 10
out 365
that 11
Jane 8
saw 24
anything 3
of 109
him 9
in 2719
London 5
Well 24
he 962
is 124
a 6799
young 9
man 342
and 51
I 4330
do 814
not 85
suppose 4
the 193
least 3
chance 20
in 2719
the 193
world 12
of 109
her 181
ever 33
him 9
now 10
There 21
is 124
no 896
talk 18
of 109
his 43
coming 3
to 805
in 2719
the 193
summer 13
and 51
I 4330
have 11
of 109
too 50
who 79
is 124
to 805
know 12
I 4330
do 814
not 85
believe 6
he 962
will 39
ever 33
live 43
at 272
any 17
more 11
Oh 17
well 24
it 67
is 124
just 24
as 509
he 962
him 9
to 805
come 36
Though 12
I 4330
shall 12
say 7
he 962
my 90
daughter 4
ill 84
and 51
if 8
I 4330
was 93
her 181
I 4330
would 5
not 85
have 11
put 47
up 194
with 34
it 67
Well 24
my 90
comfort 14
is 124
I 4330
am 392
sure 11
Jane 8
will 39
die 38
of 109
a 6799
broken 6
heart 57
and 51
then 5
he 962
will 39
be 1200
for 484
what 14
he 962
has 41
done 3
But 82
as 509
Elizabeth 5
not 85
receive 8
comfort 14
any 17
expectation 3
she 199
made 13
no 896
answer 8
Well 24
her 181
mother 21
soon 3
and 51
so 797
the 193
live 43
comfortable 3
do 814
they 5
Well 24
well 24
I 4330
hope 16
it 67
will 39
last 7
And 51
what 14
sort 14
of 109
table 27
do 814
they 5
keep 11
Charlotte 4
is 124
an 970
manager 6
I 4330
dare 15
say 7
If 8
she 199
is 124
half 23
as 509
sharp 30
as 509
her 181
mother 21
she 199
is 124
saving 4
There 21
is 124
nothing 5
in 2719
I 4330
dare 15
say 7
No 896
nothing 5
at 272
all 162
A 6799
great 12
deal 13
of 109
good 28
management 3
depend 17
it 67
Yes 16
yes 16
They 5
will 39
take 18
care 47
not 85
to 805
outrun 3
income 5
They 5
will 39
never 3
be 1200
for 484
money 17
Well 24
good 28
may 49
it 67
do 814
them 9
And 51
so 797
I 4330
suppose 4
they 5
often 4
talk 18
of 109
when 6
your 4
father 12
is 124
dead 39
They 5
look 14
it 67
as 509
own 9
I 4330
dare 15
say 7
that 11
happens 4
It 67
was 93
a 6799
subject 11
they 5
not 85
mention 5
me 1041
No 896
it 67
would 5
have 11
strange 8
if 8
they 5
had 11
but 82
I 4330
make 17
no 896
doubt 15
they 5
often 4
talk 18
of 109
it 67
Well 24
if 8
they 5
can 287
be 1200
with 34
an 970
estate 3
that 11
is 124
not 85
own 9
so 797
the 193
better 7
I 4330
should 7
be 1200
of 109
one 19
that 11
was 93
on 86
me 1041
Chapter 3

hard 70
in 2719
any 17
of 109
the 193
Good 28
Heaven 9
what 14
is 124
to 805
of 109
us 70
What 14
are 12
we 444
to 805
do 814
would 5
they 5
often 4
exclaim 4
in 2719
the 193
of 109
woe 10
How 27

Lydia 4
If 8

Oh 17

to 805
But 82
papa 13
is 124
so 797
disagreeable 3
A 6799
little 6
sea 158
would 5
set 40
me 1041
up 194
forever 3
And 51
my 90

do 814

House 87
Elizabeth 5

them 9
but 82
all 162
sense 8
of 109
pleasure 5

in 2719
shame 14
She 199
felt 5
the 193
justice 3
of 109
Mr 5

pardon 10
his 43

But 82
the 193
gloom 8
of 109
prospect 13
was 93
for 484
she 199
an 970

This 6

was 93
a 6799
young 9

married 3
A 6799

The 193

in 2719
as 509
unreasonable 3
as 509
her 181

peevish 4
I 4330
see 70
why 4
should 7
not 85
ask 6
me 1041
as 509
well 24
as 509
Lydia 4
she 199
Though 12
I 4330

just 24
as 509
right 31
to 805

more 11
too 50
for 484

In 2719

did 23
Elizabeth 5
attempt 5
to 805
make 17
her 181
reasonable 3
and 51
Jane 8
to 805
make 17

As 509
for 484
Elizabeth 5
this 6
invitation 6
was 93
so 797
far 91
in 2719
her 181
the 193
same 5
as 509
in 2719
her 181
mother 21
and 51
Lydia 4
that 11
she 199

as 509
the 193
death 19
warrant 10
of 109
all 162
of 109
common 23
sense 8
for 484
the 193
latter 3
and 51
as 509
a 6799
step 48
must 28
make 17
her 181
were 5
it 67

the 193
friendship 3
of 109
a 6799

the 193

her 181
being 3
yet 4
more 11

a 6799

at 272
where 21
the 193

He 962

If 8

Elizabeth 5
of 109
the 193

disadvantage 6
to 805

I 4330
am 392
now 10
Our 3

She 199

follow 11
Lydia 4
Vain 8

Oh 17

With 34
this 6
answer 8
Elizabeth 5
was 93
to 805
be 1200
content 18
but 82
her 181

It 67
was 93
not 85

She 199

Had 11
Lydia 4

the 193
substance 3
of 109
her 181
conference 3
with 34
her 181
father 12
would 5
have 11
found 18
expression 11
in 2719
In 2719
imagination 3
a 6799
visit 14
to 805
every 10
of 109
She 199
saw 24
with 34
the 193
creative 6
eye 57
of 109
fancy 5
the 193
of 109
that 11
gay 9
place 29
with 34
She 199
saw 24
the 193
object 26
of 109
attention 3
to 805
tens 19
and 51
to 805
of 109
them 9
at 272
present 20
unknown 3
She 199
saw 24
all 162
the 193
of 109
the 193
camp 47
forth 8
in 2719
of 109
lines 4
with 34
the 193
young 9
and 51
the 193
gay 9
and 51
with 34
and 51
to 805
complete 8
the 193
view 18

saw 24
a 6799
tent 20

six 24
at 272
Had 11

her 181
sister 9

tear 26
her 181
and 51
as 509
these 4
what 14
would 5
have 11
her 181
They 5
have 11
by 57
her 181
mother 21
who 79
might 9
have 11
felt 5
the 193

her 181
conviction 3
of 109
her 181
never 3
to 805
go 500
there 21
But 82
they 5
were 5
of 109
what 14
had 11
and 51
with 34
little 6
intermission 3
to 805
the 193
day 27
of 109
leaving 3
home 90
Elizabeth 5
was 93
now 10
to 805
see 70
Mr 5
for 484
the 193
last 7
time 45
in 2719
with 34
him 9
since 7
her 181
return 14
agitation 3
was 93
pretty 3
well 24
over 596
the 193
of 109
former 3
so 797
She 199
had 11
even 36

detect 13
in 2719
the 193

first 8
her 181
an 970
affectation 3
and 51
a 6799
to 805
disgust 7
and 51
In 2719
his 43
present 20
to 805
she 199
had 11
a 6799
fresh 22
source 4
of 109
for 484
the 193
inclination 3
he 962
soon 3
of 109
had 11
the 193
part 102
of 109
acquaintance 5

after 48
what 14
had 11
since 7
to 805
provoke 6
her 181
She 199
all 162
concern 6
for 484
him 9
in 2719
finding 4
as 509
the 193
object 26
of 109
idle 10
and 51
frivolous 4
and 51
while 4
she 199
it 67
not 85
but 82
feel 11
the 193
reproof 5
in 2719
his 43
that 11
long 49
and 51
for 484
cause 14
his 43
had 11
her 181
would 5
be 1200
and 51
her 181
preference 3
at 272
any 17
time 45
by 57
renewal 3
On 86
the 193
last 7
day 27
of 109
the 193

he 962
with 34
other 5
of 109
the 193

and 51
so 797
little 6
was 93
Elizabeth 5
to 805
part 102
him 9
in 2719
good 28
that 11
on 86
his 43
making 4
some 30
as 509
to 805
the 193
manner 8
in 2719
her 181
time 45
had 11
at 272
she 199
Colonel 5
and 51
Mr 5
both 8
three 12
at 272
and 51
him 9
if 8
he 962
was 93
with 34
the 193
former 3
He 962
but 82
with 34
a 6799
recollection 3
and 51
a 6799
smile 7
that 11
he 962
had 11
him 9
often 4
and 51
after 48
that 11
he 962
was 93
a 6799
man 342
her 181
how 27
she 199
had 11
him 9
Her 181
answer 8
was 93
in 2719
his 43
With 34
an 970
air 129
of 109
he 962
soon 3
How 27
long 49
did 23
you 29
say 7
he 962
was 93
at 272
three 12
And 51
you 29
saw 24
him 9
Yes 16
every 10
day 27
His 43
are 12
different 11
his 43
Yes 16
different 11
But 82
I 4330
think 8
Mr 5
acquaintance 5
Mr 5
with 34
a 6799
look 14
did 23
not 85
escape 10
her 181
And 51
pray 9
may 49
I 4330
ask 6
But 82
he 962
in 2719
a 6799
tone 12
Is 124
it 67
in 2719
address 9
that 11
he 962
Has 41
he 962
to 805
add 54
aught 3
of 109
to 805
his 43
style 4
for 484
I 4330
dare 15
not 85
hope 16
he 962
in 2719
a 6799
lower 9
and 51
more 11
serious 4
tone 12
that 11
he 962
is 124
in 2719
Oh 17
no 896
Elizabeth 5
In 2719
I 4330
believe 6
he 962
is 124
what 14
he 962
ever 33
was 93
While 4
she 199
spoke 14
as 509
if 8
knowing 3
to 805
rejoice 3
over 596
her 181
words 5
or 333
to 805
distrust 7
meaning 11
There 21
was 93
a 6799
something 3
in 2719
her 181
countenance 4
made 13
him 9
listen 9
with 34
an 970
apprehensive 4
and 51
anxious 4
attention 3
while 4
she 199
When 6
I 4330
that 11
he 962
on 86
acquaintance 5
I 4330
did 23
not 85
mean 36
that 11
his 43
mind 25
or 333
his 43
were 5
in 2719
a 6799
state 41
of 109
improvement 3
but 82
that 11
knowing 3
him 9
better 7
his 43
disposition 3
was 93
better 7
alarm 9
now 10
in 2719
a 6799
complexion 5
and 51
look 14
for 484
a 6799
few 6
he 962
was 93
silent 6
till 14
off 100
his 43
embarrassment 3
he 962
to 805
her 181
and 51
in 2719
the 193
of 109
You 29
who 79
so 797
well 24
know 12
my 90
feeling 4
Mr 5
will 39
comprehend 4
how 27
I 4330
must 28
rejoice 3
that 11
he 962
is 124
wise 17
to 805
assume 3
even 36
the 193
appearance 3
of 109
what 14
is 124
right 31
His 43
pride 6
in 2719
that 11
direction 5
may 49
be 1200
of 109
service 13
if 8
not 85
to 805
to 805
for 484
it 67
must 28
deter 39
him 9
foul 13
misconduct 5
as 509
I 4330
have 11
by 57
I 4330
fear 14
that 11
the 193
sort 14
of 109

I 4330
imagine 3
have 11
is 124
on 86
his 43
to 805
his 43
aunt 6
of 109
good 28
opinion 4
and 51
he 962
stands 4
in 2719
awe 10
His 43
fear 14
of 109
her 181
has 41
I 4330
know 12
when 6
they 5
were 5
together 3
and 51
a 6799
good 28
deal 13
is 124
to 805
be 1200
to 805
his 43
wish 13
of 109
the 193
match 25
with 34
Miss 71
de 2452
I 4330
am 392
certain 5
he 962
has 41
at 272
heart 57
Elizabeth 5
not 85
repress 10
a 6799
smile 7
at 272
this 6
but 82
she 199
by 57
a 6799
slight 10
inclination 3
of 109
the 193
head 140
She 199
saw 24
that 11

engage 6
her 181
on 86
the 193
old 21
subject 11
of 109
his 43

she 199
was 93
in 2719
no 896
to 805
indulge 8
him 9
The 193
rest 110
of 109
the 193
evening 3
with 34
the 193
appearance 3
on 86
his 43
side 74
of 109
usual 3
but 82
with 34
no 896
further 8
attempt 5
to 805
distinguish 5
Elizabeth 5
and 51

at 272

with 34
mutual 4
and 51
a 6799
mutual 4
desire 6

When 6

who 79
shed 4
but 82
she 199
did 23
weep 14
vexation 3
and 51
envy 4
was 93
diffuse 6
in 2719
her 181
good 28
for 484
the 193

her 181

for 484
ever 33
and 51
all 162
his 43

domestic 12
were 5
But 82
Mr 5
was 93
not 85
of 109
a 6799
disposition 3
to 805
seek 6
comfort 14
for 484
the 193

often 4
console 4
the 193
unfortunate 4

He 962
was 93
fond 17
of 109
the 193

these 4
had 11

To 805
his 43

little 6
indebted 3
than 22
as 509
her 181

had 11
to 805
his 43

This 6
is 124
not 85
the 193
sort 14
of 109
a 6799
man 342
would 5
in 2719
general 22
wish 13

a 6799
husband 10
She 199
had 11
it 67
with 34
pain 42
but 82
his 43

to 805
banish 6
her 181
that 11
breach 5

in 2719
his 43
wife 6
to 805
the 193
contempt 8
of 109
her 181

was 93
so 797
But 82
she 199
had 11
never 3
felt 5
so 797

now 10
the 193

When 6
Elizabeth 5

The 193

be 1200
better 7

They 5

then 5
found 18

or 333
where 21
natural 18
had 11
so 797
little 6
by 57
an 970
awkward 6
taste 15
They 5
were 5
all 162
of 109
them 9
warm 23
in 2719
and 51
at 272
that 11
moment 14
she 199
felt 5
that 11
to 805
be 1200
mistress 3
of 109
might 9
be 1200
something 3
They 5

drove 6
to 805
the 193

Elizabeth 5
as 509
they 5
for 484
the 193
housekeeper 3
had 11
leisure 8
to 805
wonder 17
at 272
her 181
being 3
where 21
she 199
was 93
The 193
housekeeper 3
came 36
a 6799
woman 21
less 19
fine 17
and 51
more 11
civil 15
than 22
she 199
had 11
any 17
notion 5
of 109
finding 4
her 181
They 5
her 181
into 26
the 193

a 6799
large 11

Elizabeth 5
after 48
it 67
to 805
a 6799
window 12
to 805
enjoy 9
prospect 13
The 193
hill 22
with 34
wood 96
they 5
had 11
the 193
distance 4
was 93
a 6799
object 26
Every 10
disposition 3
of 109
the 193
ground 36
was 93
good 28
and 51
she 199
on 86
the 193
whole 26
scene 5
the 193
river 17
the 193

with 34
delight 8
As 509
they 5
into 26

taking 4
different 11
but 82
every 10
window 12
there 21
were 5
to 805
be 1200
The 193
were 5
and 51
handsome 6
and 51
suitable 3
to 805
the 193
fortune 8
of 109
proprietor 7
but 82
Elizabeth 5
saw 24
with 34
of 109
his 43
taste 15
that 11
it 67
was 93
nor 102
fine 17
with 34
less 19
of 109
and 51
more 11
real 47
than 22
the 193
of 109
And 51
of 109
this 6
place 29
thought 11
she 199
I 4330
might 9
have 11
mistress 3
With 34
these 4
I 4330
might 9
now 10
have 11
of 109
viewing 3
them 9
as 509
a 6799
stranger 3
I 4330
might 9
have 11
in 2719
them 9
as 509
my 90
own 9
and 51
to 805
them 9
as 509
my 90
uncle 18
and 51
aunt 6
But 82
no 896
that 11
never 3
be 1200
my 90
uncle 18
and 51
aunt 6
would 5
have 11
to 805
me 1041
I 4330
should 7
not 85
have 11
to 805
invite 7
them 9
This 6
was 93
a 6799
recollection 3
it 67
her 181
something 3
like 22
regret 9
She 199
to 805
inquire 6
of 109
the 193
housekeeper 3
her 181
master 28
was 93
absent 14
but 82
had 11
not 85
the 193
courage 6
for 484
it 67
At 272
length 14
the 193
question 16
was 93
by 57
her 181
uncle 18
and 51
she 199
with 34
alarm 9
while 4
that 11
he 962
was 93
But 82
we 444
expect 20
him 9
to 805
morrow 3
with 34
a 6799
large 11
party 3
of 109
friends 4
How 27

Her 181

The 193

He 962

him 9
Mr 5

Elizabeth 5
not 85
help 23
saying 3
It 67
is 124
to 805
his 43
credit 12
I 4330
am 392
sure 11
that 11
you 29
should 7
think 8
so 797
I 4330
say 7
no 896
more 11
than 22
the 193
truth 7
and 51
will 39
say 7
that 11
him 9
the 193
other 5
Elizabeth 5

was 93
going 3
pretty 3
far 91
and 51
she 199
with 34

in 2719
my 90
life 44

I 4330
have 11
him 9
ever 33
since 7
he 962
was 93
four 26
old 21
This 6
was 93
praise 7
of 109
all 162
most 3
most 3
opposite 4
to 805
her 181
That 11

a 6799
good 28
man 342
had 11
her 181
opinion 4
Her 181
attention 3

hear 76
more 11
and 51
was 93
grateful 4
to 805
her 181
uncle 18
for 484
saying 3
There 21
are 12
few 6
people 4
of 109
whom 3
so 797
can 287
be 1200
You 29
are 12
in 2719
a 6799
master 28
Yes 16
sir 22
I 4330
know 12
I 4330
am 392
If 8
I 4330
were 5
to 805
go 500
through 4
the 193
world 12
I 4330
not 85
meet 9
with 34
a 6799
better 7
But 82
I 4330
have 11
that 11
they 5
who 79
are 12
good 28
when 6
are 12
good 28
when 6
they 5
grow 21
up 194
and 51
he 962
was 93
the 193
most 3
generous 4
boy 25
in 2719
the 193
world 12
Elizabeth 5
at 272
her 181
Can 287
this 6
be 1200
Mr 5
thought 11
she 199
His 43
father 12
was 93
an 970
man 342
Yes 16
that 11
he 962
was 93
and 51
his 43
son 70
will 39
be 1200
just 24
like 22
him 9
just 24
as 509
to 805
the 193
poor 11
Elizabeth 5
and 51
was 93
for 484
more 11
interest 6
her 181
on 86
no 896
other 5
point 22
She 199
related 3
the 193
of 109
the 193
pictures 5
the 193
of 109
the 193
and 51
the 193
price 6
of 109
the 193
in 2719
vain 8
Mr 5
by 57
the 193
kind 31
of 109
prejudice 4
to 805
he 962
her 181
commendation 3
of 109
her 181
master 28
soon 3
led 11
to 805
the 193
subject 11
and 51
she 199
with 34
on 86
his 43
as 509
they 5
together 3
up 194
the 193
great 12
staircase 3
He 962
is 124
the 193
best 37
landlord 3
and 51
the 193
best 37
master 28
she 199
that 11
ever 33
not 85
like 22
the 193
wild 36
young 9
men 140
who 79
think 8
of 109
nothing 5
but 82
There 21
is 124
not 85
one 19
of 109
his 43
or 333
but 82
will 39
give 15
him 9
a 6799
good 28
name 17
Some 30
people 4
call 57
him 9
proud 5
but 82
I 4330
am 392
sure 11
I 4330
never 3
saw 24
anything 3
of 109
it 67
To 805
my 90
fancy 5
it 67
is 124
he 962
does 5
not 85
rattle 17
like 22
other 5
young 9
men 140
In 2719
what 14
an 970
light 42
does 5
this 6
place 29
him 9
thought 11
Elizabeth 5
This 6
fine 17
account 14
of 109
him 9
her 181
aunt 6
as 509
they 5
is 124
not 85
with 34
his 43
to 805
our 3
poor 11
friend 14
we 444
might 9
be 1200
That 11
is 124
not 85
our 3
was 93
too 50
good 28
On 86
the 193
spacious 4
lobby 6
above 3
they 5
were 5
into 26
a 6799
pretty 3
sitting 3
room 22
up 194
with 34
and 51
than 22
the 193
and 51
were 5
that 11
it 67
was 93
but 82
just 24
done 3
to 805
give 15
pleasure 5
to 805
Miss 71
who 79
had 11
a 6799
to 805
the 193
room 22
when 6
last 7
at 272
He 962
is 124
a 6799
good 28
brother 9
Elizabeth 5
as 509
she 199
one 19
of 109
the 193
windows 4
Miss 71
delight 8
when 6
she 199
should 7
enter 23
the 193
room 22
And 51
this 6
is 124
the 193
way 27
with 34
him 9
she 199
can 287
give 15
his 43
sister 9
any 17
pleasure 5
is 124
sure 11
to 805
be 1200
done 3
in 2719
a 6799
moment 14
There 21
is 124
nothing 5
he 962
would 5
not 85
do 814
for 484
her 181
The 193
picture 8
and 51
two 14
or 333
three 12
of 109
the 193
principal 7
were 5
all 162
that 11
to 805
be 1200
In 2719
the 193
former 3
were 5
good 28
but 82
Elizabeth 5
nothing 5
of 109
the 193
art 104
and 51
as 509
had 11
she 199
had 11
to 805
look 14
at 272
some 30
of 109
Miss 71
in 2719
were 5
more 11
and 51
also 3
more 11
In 2719
the 193
there 21
were 5
but 82
they 5
have 11
little 6
to 805
fix 27
the 193
attention 3
of 109
a 6799
stranger 3
Elizabeth 5
in 2719
quest 21
of 109
the 193
face 19
would 5
be 1200
to 805
her 181
At 272
last 7
it 67
her 181
and 51
she 199
a 6799
striking 3
resemblance 3
to 805
Mr 5
with 34
a 6799
smile 7
over 596
the 193
face 19
as 509
she 199
to 805
have 11
when 6
he 962
at 272
her 181
She 199
several 3
the 193
picture 8
in 2719
earnest 8
and 51
to 805
it 67
they 5
the 193
them 9
that 11
it 67
had 11
in 2719
his 43
lifetime 3
There 21
was 93
at 272
this 6
moment 14
in 2719
mind 25
a 6799
more 11
gentle 18
sensation 14
the 193
original 6
than 22
she 199
had 11
ever 33
felt 5
at 272
the 193
height 7
of 109
acquaintance 5
The 193
commendation 3
on 86
him 9
by 57
was 93
of 109
no 896
nature 3
What 14
praise 7
is 124
more 11
valuable 3
than 22
the 193
praise 7
of 109
an 970
intelligent 4
servant 3
As 509
a 6799
brother 9
a 6799
landlord 3
a 6799
master 28
she 199
how 27
were 5
in 2719
his 43
how 27
of 109
pleasure 5
or 333
pain 42
was 93
it 67
in 2719
his 43
power 19
to 805
bestow 7
how 27
of 109
good 28
or 333
evil 15
must 28
be 1200
done 3
by 57
him 9
Every 10
idea 21
that 11
had 11
forward 12
by 57
the 193
housekeeper 3
was 93
to 805
his 43
character 16
and 51
as 509
she 199
the 193
canvas 16
on 86
he 962
was 93
and 51
his 43
eyes 8
she 199
thought 11
of 109
his 43
regard 7
with 34
a 6799
sentiment 18
of 109
than 22
it 67
had 11
ever 33
she 199
and 51
of 109
expression 11
When 6
all 162
of 109
the 193
house 87
that 11
was 93
open 21
to 805
general 22
inspection 3
had 11
they 5
and 51
taking 4
leave 14
of 109
the 193
housekeeper 3
were 5
over 596
to 805
the 193
gardener 3
who 79
met 180
them 9
at 272
the 193
hall 45

As 509

to 805
look 14
her 181
uncle 18
and 51
aunt 6
also 3
and 51
while 4
the 193
former 3
was 93
as 509
to 805
the 193
date 15
of 109
the 193
building 3
the 193
owner 5
of 109
it 67
came 36
forward 12
the 193
road 38
led 11
behind 4
it 67
to 805
the 193
They 5
were 5
within 3
yards 4
of 109
other 5
and 51
so 797
abrupt 6
was 93
his 43
appearance 3
that 11
it 67
was 93
to 805
avoid 8
his 43
sight 17
eyes 8
met 180
and 51
the 193
of 109
both 8
were 5
overspread 3
with 34
the 193
blush 8
He 962
and 51
for 484
a 6799
moment 14
surprise 4
but 82
the 193
party 3
and 51
spoke 14
to 805
Elizabeth 5
if 8
not 85
in 2719
of 109
perfect 24
at 272
least 3
of 109
perfect 24
She 199
had 11
but 82
on 86
his 43
approach 6
his 43
with 34
an 970
embarrassment 3
to 805
be 1200
Had 11
his 43
first 8
appearance 3
or 333
his 43
resemblance 3
to 805
the 193
picture 8
they 5
had 11
just 24
to 805
assure 6
the 193
other 5
two 14
that 11
they 5
now 10
saw 24
Mr 5
the 193
expression 11
of 109
surprise 4
on 86
his 43
master 28
must 28
have 11
it 67
They 5
a 6799
little 6
aloof 4
while 4
he 962
was 93
to 805
niece 3
who 79
and 51
dared 6
lift 11
her 181
eyes 8
to 805
his 43
face 19
and 51
not 85
what 14
answer 8
she 199
to 805
his 43
civil 15
after 48
her 181
at 272
the 193
alteration 3
of 109
his 43
manner 8
since 7
they 5
last 7
every 10
sentence 4
that 11
he 962
was 93
her 181
embarrassment 3
and 51
every 10
idea 21
of 109
the 193
of 109
her 181
being 3
found 18
there 21
to 805
her 181
mind 25
the 193
few 6
in 2719
they 5
were 5
some 30
of 109
the 193
most 3
in 2719
her 181
life 44
Nor 102
did 23
he 962
seem 10
more 11
at 272
ease 10
when 6
he 962
spoke 14
his 43
accent 14
had 11
none 32
of 109
usual 3
and 51
he 962
his 43
as 509
to 805
the 193
time 45
of 109
her 181
left 19
and 51
of 109
her 181
in 2719
so 797
often 4
and 51
in 2719
so 797
a 6799
way 27
as 509
spoke 14
the 193
distraction 3
of 109
his 43
At 272
length 14
every 10
idea 21
to 805
fail 12
him 9
and 51
after 48
standing 3
a 6799
few 6
saying 3
a 6799
word 26
he 962
and 51
leave 14
The 193
then 5
her 181
and 51
of 109
his 43
figure 7
but 82
Elizabeth 5
not 85
a 6799
word 26
and 51
by 57
her 181
own 9
them 9
in 2719
silence 7
She 199
was 93
by 57
shame 14
and 51
vexation 3
Her 181
coming 3
there 21
was 93
the 193
most 3
unfortunate 4
the 193
most 3
ill 84
thing 15
in 2719
the 193
world 12
How 27
strange 8
it 67
must 28
appear 7
to 805
him 9
In 2719
what 14
a 6799
disgraceful 4
light 42
might 9
it 67
not 85
strike 14
so 797
vain 8
a 6799
man 342
It 67
might 9
seem 10
as 509
if 8
she 199
had 11
in 2719
his 43
way 27
Oh 17
why 4
did 23
she 199
come 36
Or 333
why 4
did 23
he 962
come 36
a 6799
day 27
he 962
was 93
Had 11
they 5
ten 151
they 5
should 7
have 11
the 193
reach 6
of 109
his 43
for 484
it 67
was 93
plain 27
that 11
he 962
was 93
that 11
moment 14
that 11
moment 14
his 43
horse 52
or 333
his 43
carriage 5
She 199
and 51
over 596
the 193
of 109
the 193
meeting 6
And 51
his 43
so 797
what 14
it 67
mean 36
That 11
he 962
should 7
even 36
speak 12
to 805
her 181
was 93
but 82
to 805
speak 12
with 34
to 805
inquire 6
after 48
her 181
Never 3
in 2719
her 181
life 44
had 11
she 199
his 43
so 797
little 6
never 3
had 11
he 962
with 34
as 509
on 86
this 6
unexpected 4
meeting 6
What 14
a 6799
contrast 5
did 23
it 67
offer 10
to 805
his 43
last 7
address 9
in 2719
Park 18
when 6
he 962
put 47
his 43
letter 20
into 26
her 181
hand 137
She 199
not 85
what 14
to 805
think 8
or 333
how 27
to 805
account 14
for 484
it 67
They 5
had 11
now 10
a 6799
walk 25
by 57
the 193
side 74
of 109
the 193
water 88
and 51
every 10
step 48
was 93
forward 12
a 6799
fall 29
of 109
ground 36
or 333
a 6799
finer 3
reach 6
of 109
the 193
woods 15
to 805
they 5
were 5
but 82
it 67
was 93
some 30
time 45
Elizabeth 5
was 93
sensible 3
of 109
any 17
of 109
it 67
and 51
though 12
she 199
to 805
the 193
of 109
her 181
uncle 18
and 51
aunt 6
and 51
to 805
direct 30
her 181
eyes 8
to 805
as 509
they 5
out 365
she 199
no 896
part 102
of 109
the 193
scene 5
Her 181
were 5
all 162
on 86
that 11
one 19
spot 24
of 109
House 87
it 67
might 9
be 1200
where 21
Mr 5
then 5
was 93
She 199
to 805

with 34
the 193
general 22
air 129
of 109
the 193
scene 5

was 93
a 6799

as 509
possible 3
Her 181

on 86
the 193
opposite 4
side 74
of 109
the 193
river 17
in 2719
the 193
direction 5
but 82
progress 14
was 93
slow 17
for 484
Mr 5
though 12
able 3
to 805
indulge 8
the 193
taste 15
was 93
fond 17
of 109
and 51
was 93
so 797
in 2719
the 193
appearance 3
of 109
some 30
trout 3
in 2719
the 193
water 88
and 51
to 805
the 193
man 342
them 9
that 11
he 962
but 82
little 6
wandering 3
on 86
in 2719
this 6
slow 17
manner 8
they 5
were 5
and 51
was 93
equal 17
to 805
what 14
it 67
had 11
at 272
first 8
by 57
the 193
sight 17
of 109
Mr 5
them 9
and 51
at 272
no 896
great 12
distance 4
The 193
walk 25
here 31
being 3
here 31
less 19
than 22
on 86
the 193
other 5
side 74
them 9
to 805
see 70
him 9
they 5
met 180
Elizabeth 5
was 93
at 272
least 3
more 11
prepared 3
for 484
an 970
interview 11
than 22
and 51
to 805
appear 7
and 51
to 805
speak 12
with 34
if 8
he 962
intended 3
to 805
meet 9
them 9
For 484
a 6799
few 6
she 199
felt 5
that 11
he 962
would 5
strike 14
into 26
some 30
other 5
path 25
The 193
idea 21
while 4
a 6799
turning 3
in 2719
the 193
walk 25
him 9
view 18
the 193
turning 3
past 71
he 962
was 93
them 9
With 34
a 6799
glance 4
she 199
saw 24
that 11
he 962
had 11
none 32
of 109
his 43
recent 6
and 51
to 805
imitate 3
his 43
she 199
as 509
they 5
met 180
to 805
admire 6
the 193
of 109
the 193
place 29
but 82
she 199
had 11
not 85
got 14
the 193
words 5
and 51
when 6
some 30
and 51
she 199
that 11
praise 7
of 109
her 181
might 9
be 1200
Her 181
and 51
she 199
no 896
more 11
was 93
standing 3
a 6799
little 6
behind 4
and 51
on 86
her 181
he 962
her 181
if 8
she 199
would 5
do 814
him 9
the 193
of 109
him 9
to 805
her 181
friends 4
This 6
was 93
a 6799
stroke 4
of 109
for 484
she 199
was 93
unprepared 3
and 51
she 199
suppress 13
a 6799
smile 7
at 272
his 43
being 3
now 10
the 193
acquaintance 5
of 109
some 30
of 109
people 4
whom 3
his 43
pride 6
had 11
in 2719
his 43
offer 10
to 805
What 14
will 39
be 1200
his 43
surprise 4
thought 11
she 199
when 6
he 962
who 79
they 5
are 12
He 962
them 9
now 10
for 484
people 4
of 109
fashion 10
The 193
introduction 3
was 93
made 13
and 51
as 509
she 199
named 4
relationship 3
to 805
she 199
stole 4
a 6799
sly 4
look 14
at 272
him 9
to 805
see 70
how 27
he 962
bore 13
it 67
and 51
was 93
not 85
the 193
expectation 3
of 109
his 43
as 509
fast 29
as 509
he 962
disgraceful 4
companions 3
That 11
he 962
was 93
by 57
the 193
connection 3

it 67
with 34
and 51
so 797
far 91
going 3
back 182
with 34

and 51
into 26
conversation 8
with 34
Mr 5
Elizabeth 5
not 85
but 82

It 67
was 93
that 11
he 962
should 7
know 12
she 199
had 11
some 30
relations 4
for 484
whom 3
there 21
was 93
no 896
need 29
to 805
blush 8
She 199
most 3
to 805
all 162
that 11
them 9
and 51
in 2719
every 10

look 14
expressive 4
of 109
wonder 17
Elizabeth 5
nothing 5
but 82
it 67
her 181
the 193
compliment 6

over 596
On 86
Mr 5
and 51
coming 3
up 194
they 5
were 5
all 162
to 805
go 500
into 26
the 193
house 87
and 51
take 18
some 30
refreshment 4
but 82
this 6
was 93
and 51
they 5
on 86
side 74
with 34
Mr 5
the 193
into 26
the 193
carriage 5
and 51
when 6
it 67
drove 6
off 100
Elizabeth 5
saw 24
him 9
the 193
house 87
The 193
of 109
her 181
uncle 18
and 51
aunt 6
now 10
and 51
of 109
them 9
him 9
to 805
be 1200
superior 5
to 805
anything 3
they 5
had 11
He 962
is 124
well 24
polite 8
and 51
her 181
uncle 18
There 21
is 124
something 3
a 6799
little 6
in 2719
him 9
to 805
be 1200
sure 11
her 181
aunt 6
but 82
it 67
is 124
to 805
his 43
air 129
and 51
is 124
not 85
I 4330
can 287
now 10
say 7
with 34
the 193
housekeeper 3
that 11
though 12
some 30
people 4
may 49
call 57
him 9
proud 5
I 4330
have 11
nothing 5
of 109
it 67
I 4330
was 93
never 3
more 11
than 22
by 57
his 43
to 805
us 70
It 67
was 93
more 11
than 22
civil 15
it 67
was 93
attentive 4
and 51
there 21
was 93
no 896
for 484
attention 3
His 43
acquaintance 5
with 34
Elizabeth 5
was 93
To 805
be 1200
sure 11
her 181
aunt 6
he 962
is 124
not 85
so 797
handsome 6
as 509
or 333
he 962
has 41
not 85
countenance 4
for 484
his 43
are 12
good 28
But 82
how 27
came 36
you 29
to 805
tell 16
me 1041
that 11
he 962
was 93
so 797
disagreeable 3
Elizabeth 5
as 509
well 24
as 509
she 199
that 11
she 199
had 11
him 9
better 7
when 6
they 5
had 11
met 180
in 2719
Kent 9
than 22
and 51
that 11
she 199
had 11
never 3
him 9
so 797
pleasant 9
as 509
this 6
morning 3
But 82
he 962
may 49
be 1200
a 6799
little 6
whimsical 4
in 2719
his 43
her 181
uncle 18
Your 4
great 12
men 140
often 4
are 12
and 51
I 4330
shall 12
not 85
take 18
him 9
at 272
his 43
word 26
as 509
he 962
might 9
change 21
his 43
mind 25
day 27
and 51
warn 8
me 1041
off 100
his 43
grounds 10
Elizabeth 5
felt 5
that 11
they 5
had 11
his 43
character 16
but 82
nothing 5
what 14
we 444
have 11
of 109
him 9
I 4330
should 7
not 85
have 11
thought 11
that 11
he 962
have 11
in 2719
so 797
cruel 9
a 6799
way 27
by 57
as 509
he 962
has 41
done 3
by 57
poor 11
He 962
has 41
not 85
an 970
ill 84
look 14
On 86
the 193
there 21
is 124
something 3
pleasing 3
his 43
mouth 22
when 6
he 962
And 51
there 21
is 124
something 3
of 109
in 2719
his 43
countenance 4
that 11
would 5
not 85
give 15
one 19
an 970
idea 21
of 109
his 43
heart 57
But 82
to 805
be 1200
sure 11
the 193
good 28
lady 18
who 79
us 70
his 43
house 87
did 23
give 15
him 9
a 6799
most 3
flaming 5
character 16
I 4330
help 23
laughing 6
But 82
he 962
is 124
a 6799
liberal 17
master 28
I 4330
suppose 4
and 51
that 11
in 2719
the 193
eye 57
of 109
a 6799
servant 3
every 10
virtue 3
Elizabeth 5
here 31
felt 5
on 86
to 805
say 7
something 3
in 2719
vindication 3
of 109
his 43
to 805
and 51
gave 4
them 9
to 805
understand 8
in 2719
as 509
a 6799
manner 8
as 509
she 199
that 11
by 57
what 14
she 199
had 11
his 43
relations 4
in 2719
Kent 9
his 43
were 5
of 109
a 6799
different 11
construction 7
and 51
that 11
his 43
character 16
was 93
by 57
no 896
so 797
nor 102
so 797
as 509
they 5
had 11
in 2719
In 2719
confirmation 3
of 109
this 6
she 199
related 3
the 193
of 109
all 162
the 193
in 2719
they 5
had 11
her 181
but 82
it 67
to 805
be 1200
as 509
might 9
be 1200
on 86
was 93
and 51
but 82
as 509
they 5
were 5
now 10
the 193
scene 5
of 109
her 181
former 3
every 10
idea 21
gave 4
way 27
to 805
the 193
charm 14
of 109
recollection 3
and 51
she 199
was 93
too 50
in 2719
out 365
to 805
her 181
husband 10
all 162
the 193
in 2719
to 805
think 8
of 109
anything 3
as 509
she 199
had 11
by 57
the 193
walk 25
they 5
had 11
no 896
than 22
she 199
set 40
off 100
in 2719
quest 21
of 109
her 181
former 3
acquaintance 5
and 51
the 193
evening 3
was 93
in 2719
the 193
of 109
an 970
after 48
discontinuance 3
The 193
of 109
the 193
day 27
were 5
too 50
full 16
of 109
interest 6
to 805
leave 14
Elizabeth 5
attention 3
for 484
any 17
of 109
these 4
new 115
friends 4
and 51
she 199
do 814
nothing 5
but 82
think 8
and 51
think 8
with 34
wonder 17
of 109
Mr 5
and 51
above 3
all 162
of 109
his 43
her 181
to 805
be 1200
with 34
his 43
sister 9
Chapter 3
Elizabeth 5
had 11
it 67
that 11
Mr 5
would 5
bring 6
his 43
sister 9
to 805
visit 14
her 181
the 193
day 27
after 48
her 181
and 51
was 93
not 85
to 805
be 1200
out 365
of 109
sight 17
of 109
the 193
inn 59
the 193
whole 26
of 109
that 11
morning 3
But 82
her 181
conclusion 3
was 93
false 12
for 484
on 86
the 193
morning 3
after 48
arrival 3
at 272
these 4
came 36
They 5
had 11
the 193
place 29
with 34
some 30
of 109
new 115
friends 4
and 51
were 5
just 24
to 805
the 193
inn 59
to 805
dress 22
for 484
with 34
the 193
same 5
when 6
the 193
sound 29
of 109
a 6799
carriage 5
them 9
to 805
a 6799
window 12
and 51
they 5
saw 24
a 6799
gentleman 3
and 51
a 6799
lady 18
in 2719
a 6799
up 194
the 193
street 15
Elizabeth 5
the 193
livery 5
what 14
it 67
meant 3
and 51
no 896
small 14
degree 3
of 109
her 181
surprise 4
to 805
her 181
relations 4
by 57
them 9
with 34
the 193
she 199
Her 181
uncle 18
and 51
aunt 6
were 5
all 162
and 51
the 193
embarrassment 3
of 109
her 181
manner 8
as 509
she 199
spoke 14
to 805
the 193
circumstance 4
and 51
of 109
the 193
of 109
the 193
day 27
to 805
them 9
a 6799
new 115
idea 21
on 86
the 193
business 13
Nothing 5
had 11
ever 33
it 67
but 82
they 5
felt 5
that 11
there 21
was 93
no 896
other 5
way 27
of 109
for 484
a 6799
quarter 25
than 22
by 57
a 6799
for 484
niece 3
While 4
these 4
newly 4
born 4
were 5
passing 3
in 2719
heads 25
the 193
perturbation 3
of 109
was 93
at 272
every 10
moment 14
She 199
was 93
at 272
her 181
own 9
but 82
other 5
of 109
disquiet 7
she 199
lest 5
the 193
of 109
the 193
brother 9
should 7
have 11
too 50
in 2719
her 181
and 51
more 11
than 22
anxious 4
to 805
please 3
she 199
that 11
every 10
power 19
of 109
pleasing 3
would 5
fail 12
her 181
She 199
the 193
window 12
fearful 4
of 109
being 3
and 51
as 509
she 199
up 194
and 51
down 90
the 193
room 22
to 805
compose 7
saw 24
of 109
surprise 4
in 2719
her 181
uncle 18
and 51
aunt 6
as 509
made 13
worse 6
Miss 71
and 51
her 181
brother 9
and 51
this 6
introduction 3
place 29
With 34
did 23
Elizabeth 5
see 70
that 11
her 181
new 115
acquaintance 5
was 93
at 272
least 3
as 509
as 509
Since 7
her 181
being 3
at 272
she 199
had 11
that 11
Miss 71
was 93
proud 5
but 82
the 193
observation 4
of 109
a 6799
few 6
her 181
that 11
she 199
was 93
shy 14
She 199
found 18
it 67
difficult 5
to 805
obtain 7
even 36
a 6799
word 26
her 181
a 6799
monosyllable 3
Miss 71
was 93
tall 35
and 51
on 86
a 6799
scale 6
than 22
Elizabeth 5
and 51
though 12
little 6
more 11
than 22
sixteen 6
her 181
figure 7
was 93
and 51
her 181
appearance 3
and 51
graceful 4
She 199
was 93
less 19
handsome 6
than 22
her 181
brother 9
but 82
there 21
was 93
sense 8
and 51
good 28
in 2719
her 181
face 19
and 51
her 181
were 5
and 51
gentle 18
Elizabeth 5
who 79
had 11
to 805
find 10
in 2719
her 181
as 509
acute 8
and 51
an 970
observer 3
as 509
ever 33
Mr 5
had 11
was 93
by 57
different 11
They 5
had 11
not 85
long 49
together 3
Mr 5
her 181
that 11
was 93
also 3
coming 3
to 805
wait 19
on 86
her 181
and 51
she 199
had 11
time 45
to 805
express 25
her 181
satisfaction 3
and 51
prepare 5
for 484
a 6799
visitor 3
when 6
quick 25
step 48
was 93
on 86
the 193
and 51
in 2719
a 6799
moment 14
he 962
the 193
room 22
All 162
anger 5
him 9
had 11
long 49
done 3
but 82
had 11
she 199
still 13
felt 5
any 17
it 67
have 11
ground 36
the 193
with 34
he 962
on 86
her 181
He 962
in 2719
a 6799
though 12
general 22
way 27
after 48
her 181
and 51
and 51
spoke 14
with 34
the 193
same 5
good 28
ease 10
that 11
he 962
had 11
ever 33
done 3
To 805
Mr 5
and 51
he 962
was 93
a 6799
less 19
personage 3
than 22
to 805
They 5
had 11
long 49
to 805
see 70
him 9
The 193
whole 26
party 3
them 9
a 6799
attention 3
The 193
had 11
just 24
of 109
Mr 5
and 51
niece 3
observation 4
with 34
an 970
earnest 8
though 12
and 51
they 5
soon 3
the 193
full 16
conviction 3
that 11
one 19
of 109
them 9
at 272
least 3
what 14
it 67
was 93
to 805
love 29
Of 109
the 193
they 5
a 6799
little 6
in 2719
doubt 15
but 82
that 11
the 193
gentleman 3
was 93
with 34
was 93
Elizabeth 5
on 86
her 181
side 74
had 11
to 805
do 814
She 199
to 805
ascertain 7
the 193
of 109
of 109
her 181
she 199
to 805
compose 7
her 181
own 9
and 51
to 805
make 17
agreeable 3
to 805
all 162
and 51
in 2719
the 193
latter 3
object 26
where 21
she 199
most 3
to 805
fail 12
she 199
was 93
most 3
sure 11
of 109
success 13
for 484
to 805
whom 3
she 199
to 805
give 15
pleasure 5

in 2719
her 181
was 93
was 93
eager 6
and 51
to 805
be 1200
In 2719
her 181
to 805
her 181
sister 9
and 51
oh 17
how 27
did 23
she 199
long 49
to 805
know 12
any 17
of 109
his 43
were 5
in 2719
a 6799
like 22
manner 8
she 199
fancy 5
that 11
he 962
less 19
than 22
on 86
former 3
and 51
or 333
with 34
the 193
notion 5
that 11
as 509

how 27
her 181
appearance 3
at 272
must 28
be 1200
to 805
her 181
and 51
was 93
curious 4
to 805
know 12
with 34
how 27
on 86
that 11
side 74
the 193

On 86

with 34
all 162
the 193
embarrassment 3
though 12
proceeding 3
and 51
the 193
fear 14
of 109
doing 3
wrong 24
would 5
give 15
to 805
who 79
felt 5
inferior 5
the 193
belief 3
of 109

on 86
being 3
a 6799
pause 4
awkward 6
as 509

be 1200
for 484
a 6799

It 67

it 67
and 51
did 23
venture 8
a 6799
short 62
sentence 4
when 6
there 21
was 93
least 3
danger 7
of 109

Elizabeth 5
soon 3
saw 24
that 11

a 6799
word 26
to 805
Miss 71
calling 3
her 181
attention 3
This 6
observation 4
would 5
not 85

talk 18
to 805
the 193
latter 3
had 11

In 2719

In 2719

Had 11
Miss 71

intended 3
to 805
discompose 3

by 57
forward 12
the 193
idea 21
of 109

He 962
had 11
a 6799

meaning 11
that 11
it 67
should 7
affect 15
his 43

him 9
Miss 71
it 67
is 124
probable 3
that 11
it 67
might 9
add 54
something 3
to 805
his 43
concern 6
for 484
the 193

his 43

after 48

Miss 71

But 82

not 85

Her 181
recommendation 3
was 93
to 805
ensure 6
her 181
his 43

And 51
he 962
had 11
in 2719
of 109
Elizabeth 5

leave 14
the 193
power 19

When 6

him 9
some 30
part 102
of 109
what 14
she 199
had 11
saying 3
to 805
his 43
sister 9
How 27
ill 84
Miss 71
Eliza 7
this 6
morning 3
Mr 5
she 199
I 4330
never 3
in 2719
my 90
life 44
saw 24
so 797
as 509
she 199
is 124
since 7
the 193
winter 13
She 199
is 124
grown 4
so 797
brown 25
and 51
coarse 10
and 51
I 4330
were 5
that 11
we 444
should 7
not 85
have 11
her 181
little 6
Mr 5
might 9
have 11
an 970
address 9
he 962
contented 4
with 34
that 11
he 962
no 896
other 5
alteration 3
than 22
her 181
being 3
no 896
consequence 3
of 109
in 2719
the 193
summer 13
For 484
my 90
own 9
part 102
she 199
I 4330
must 28
confess 14
that 11
I 4330
never 3
see 70
any 17
in 2719
her 181
Her 181
face 19
is 124
too 50
thin 35
her 181
complexion 5
has 41
no 896
and 51
her 181

not 85
at 272
all 162
handsome 6
Her 181
nose 20
character 16
there 21
is 124
nothing 5
in 2719
lines 4
Her 181
teeth 6
are 12
but 82
not 85
out 365
of 109
the 193
common 23
way 27
and 51
as 509
for 484
her 181
eyes 8
have 11
so 797
fine 17
I 4330
never 3
see 70
anything 3
in 2719
them 9
They 5
have 11
a 6799
sharp 30
look 14
I 4330
do 814
not 85
like 22
at 272
all 162
and 51
in 2719
her 181
air 129
there 21
is 124
a 6799
self 11
fashion 10
is 124
as 509
Miss 71
was 93
that 11
Elizabeth 5
this 6
was 93
not 85
the 193
best 37
method 18
of 109
but 82
people 4
are 12
not 85
wise 17
and 51
in 2719
him 9
at 272
last 7
look 14
she 199
had 11
all 162
the 193
success 13
she 199
He 962
was 93
silent 6
and 51
a 6799
determination 3
of 109
making 4
him 9
speak 12
she 199
I 4330
remember 4
when 6
we 444
first 8
her 181
in 2719
how 27
we 444
all 162
were 5
to 805
find 10
that 11
she 199
was 93
a 6799
and 51
I 4330
recollect 7
your 4
saying 3
one 19
night 61
after 48
they 5
had 11
at 272
She 199
a 6799
I 4330
should 7
as 509
soon 3
call 57
her 181
mother 21
a 6799
wit 77
But 82
she 199
to 805
improve 6
on 86
you 29
and 51
I 4330
believe 6
you 29
thought 11
her 181
pretty 3
at 272
one 19
time 45
Yes 16
who 79
contain 16
no 896
but 82
that 11
was 93
when 6
I 4330
first 8
saw 24
her 181
for 484
it 67
is 124
since 7
I 4330
have 11
her 181
as 509
one 19
of 109
the 193
women 5
of 109
my 90
acquaintance 5
He 962
then 5
and 51
Miss 71
was 93
left 19
to 805
all 162
the 193
satisfaction 3
of 109
him 9
to 805
say 7
what 14
gave 4
no 896
one 19
any 17
pain 42
but 82
and 51
Elizabeth 5
of 109
all 162
that 11
had 11
visit 14
as 509
they 5
except 10
what 14
had 11
them 9
both 8
The 193
look 14
and 51
of 109
they 5
had 11
were 5
except 10
of 109
the 193
person 33
who 79
had 11
attention 3
They 5
of 109
his 43
sister 9
his 43
friends 4
his 43
house 87
his 43
fruit 25
of 109
but 82
yet 4
Elizabeth 5
was 93
longing 4
to 805
know 12
what 14
thought 11
of 109
him 9
and 51
would 5
have 11
by 57
her 181
beginning 3
the 193
subject 11
Chapter 3
Elizabeth 5
had 11
a 6799
good 28
deal 13
in 2719
not 85
finding 4
a 6799
letter 20
Jane 8
on 86
first 8
arrival 3
at 272
and 51
this 6
disappointment 3
had 11
on 86
of 109
the 193
that 11
had 11
now 10
there 21
but 82
on 86
the 193
third 4
her 181

over 596
and 51
her 181
sister 9
by 57
the 193
receipt 5
of 109
two 14
her 181
at 272
on 86
one 19
of 109
was 93
that 11
it 67
had 11
Elizabeth 5
was 93
not 85
at 272
it 67
as 509
Jane 8
had 11
the 193
direction 5
ill 84
They 5
had 11
just 24
to 805
walk 25
as 509
the 193
came 36
in 2719
and 51
her 181
uncle 18
and 51
aunt 6
leaving 3
her 181
to 805
enjoy 9
them 9
in 2719
quiet 20
set 40
off 100
by 57
The 193
one 19
must 28
first 8
be 1200
to 805
it 67
had 11
five 5
ago 15
The 193
beginning 3
an 970
account 14
of 109
all 162
little 6
and 51
with 34
news 71
as 509
the 193
country 12
but 82
the 193
latter 3
half 23
was 93
a 6799
day 27
later 9
and 51
in 2719
agitation 3
gave 4
more 11
It 67
was 93
to 805
this 6
effect 15
Since 7
writing 3
the 193
above 3
something 3
has 41
of 109
a 6799
most 3
unexpected 4
and 51
serious 4
nature 3
but 82
I 4330
am 392
of 109
you 29
be 1200
assured 4
that 11
we 444
are 12
all 162
well 24
What 14
I 4330
have 11
to 805
say 7
to 805
poor 11
Lydia 4
An 970
express 25
came 36
at 272
twelve 6
last 7
night 61
just 24
as 509
we 444
were 5
all 162
gone 4
to 805
bed 93
Colonel 5
to 805
inform 21
us 70
that 11
she 199
was 93
gone 4
off 100
to 805
with 34
one 19
of 109
his 43
to 805
own 9
the 193
truth 7
with 34
Imagine 3
our 3
surprise 4
To 805
it 67
does 5
not 85
seem 10
so 797
unexpected 4
I 4330
am 392
So 797
a 6799
match 25
on 86
both 8
sides 23
But 82
I 4330
am 392
willing 4
to 805
hope 16
the 193
best 37
and 51
that 11
his 43
character 16
has 41
Thoughtless 4
and 51
I 4330
can 287
believe 6
him 9
but 82
this 6
step 48
and 51
let 50
us 70
rejoice 3
over 596
it 67
marks 6
nothing 5
bad 33
at 272
heart 57
His 43
choice 5
is 124
disinterested 4
at 272
least 3
for 484
he 962
must 28
know 12
my 90
father 12
can 287
give 15
her 181
nothing 5
Our 3
poor 11
mother 21
is 124
My 90
father 12
bears 4
it 67
better 7
How 27
thankful 4
am 392
I 4330
that 11
we 444
never 3
let 50
them 9
know 12
what 14
has 41
him 9
we 444
must 28
forget 8
it 67
They 5
were 5
off 100
Saturday 3
night 61
twelve 6
as 509
is 124
but 82
were 5

The 193

sent 35
off 100
My 90

within 3
ten 151
miles 4
of 109
us 70
Colonel 5

reason 13
to 805
expect 20
him 9
here 31
soon 3
Lydia 4
left 19
a 6799
few 6
lines 4
for 484
his 43
wife 6
her 181
of 109
intention 5
I 4330
must 28
conclude 3
for 484
I 4330
be 1200
long 49
my 90
poor 11
mother 21
I 4330
am 392
you 29
will 39
not 85
be 1200
able 3
to 805
make 17
it 67
out 365
but 82
I 4330
know 12
what 14
I 4330
have 11
time 45
for 484
consideration 3
and 51
knowing 3
what 14
she 199
felt 5
Elizabeth 5
on 86
this 6
letter 20
the 193
other 5
and 51
opening 3
it 67
with 34
the 193
impatience 3
read 49
as 509
it 67
had 11
a 6799
day 27
later 9
than 22
the 193
conclusion 3
of 109
the 193
first 8
By 57
this 6
time 45
my 90
sister 9
you 29
have 11
my 90
letter 20
I 4330
wish 13
this 6
may 49
be 1200
more 11
but 82
though 12
not 85
for 484
time 45
my 90
head 140
is 124
so 797
that 11
I 4330
answer 8
for 484
being 3
I 4330
know 12
what 14
I 4330
would 5
write 5
but 82
I 4330
have 11
bad 33
news 71
for 484
you 29
and 51
it 67
be 1200
as 509
the 193
marriage 6
Mr 5
and 51
our 3
poor 11
Lydia 4
would 5
be 1200
we 444
are 12
now 10
anxious 4
to 805
be 1200
assured 4
it 67
has 41
place 29
for 484
there 21
is 124
but 82
too 50
reason 13
to 805
fear 14
they 5
are 12
not 85
gone 4
to 805
Colonel 5
came 36
yesterday 3
left 19
the 193
day 27
not 85
after 48
the 193
express 25
Though 12
short 62
letter 20
to 805
F 4832
gave 4
them 9
to 805
understand 8
that 11
they 5
were 5
going 3
to 805
Green 57
something 3
was 93
by 57
his 43
belief 3
that 11
W 3169
never 3
intended 3
to 805
go 500
there 21
or 333
to 805
Lydia 4
at 272
all 162
was 93
to 805
Colonel 5
F 4832
who 79
taking 4
the 193
alarm 9
set 40
off 100
B 7200
to 805
trace 13
route 8
He 962
did 23
trace 13
them 9
to 805
but 82
no 896
further 8
for 484
on 86
that 11
place 29
they 5
into 26
a 6799
hackney 5
coach 11
and 51
the 193
chaise 3
that 11
them 9
All 162
that 11
is 124
after 48
this 6
is 124
that 11
they 5
were 5
to 805
continue 3
the 193
London 5
road 38
I 4330
know 12
not 85
what 14
to 805
think 8
After 48
making 4
every 10
possible 3
on 86
that 11
side 74
London 5
Colonel 5
F 4832
came 36
on 86
into 26
them 9
at 272
all 162
the 193
and 51
at 272
the 193
in 2719
and 51
but 82
any 17
success 13
no 896
people 4
had 11
to 805
pass 66
through 4
With 34
the 193
concern 6
he 962
came 36
on 86
to 805
and 51
broke 15
his 43
to 805
us 70
in 2719
a 6799
manner 8
most 3
to 805
his 43
heart 57
I 4330
am 392
for 484
him 9
and 51
F 4832
but 82
no 896
one 19
can 287
throw 14
any 17
blame 12
on 86
them 9
Our 3
distress 7
my 90
dear 15
is 124
great 12
My 90
father 12
and 51
mother 21
believe 6
the 193
worst 6
but 82
I 4330
think 8
so 797
ill 84
of 109
him 9
might 9
make 17
it 67
more 11
for 484
them 9
to 805
be 1200
married 3
in 2719
town 27
than 22
to 805
pursue 6
first 8
plan 61
and 51
even 36
if 8
he 962
form 68
a 6799
design 16
a 6799
young 9
woman 21
of 109
is 124
not 85
can 287
I 4330
suppose 4
her 181
so 797
to 805
I 4330
grieve 6
to 805
find 10
that 11
Colonel 5
F 4832
is 124
not 85
to 805
depend 17
marriage 6
he 962
his 43
head 140
when 6
I 4330
my 90
and 51
he 962
W 3169
was 93
not 85
a 6799
man 342
to 805
be 1200
My 90
poor 11
mother 21
is 124
ill 84
and 51
keeps 4
her 181
room 22
she 199
exert 7
it 67
would 5
be 1200
better 7
but 82
this 6
is 124
not 85
to 805
be 1200
And 51
as 509
to 805
my 90
father 12
I 4330
never 3
in 2719
my 90
life 44
saw 24
him 9
so 797
Poor 11
has 41
anger 5
for 484
attachment 3
but 82
as 509
it 67
was 93
a 6799
matter 7
of 109
confidence 3
one 19
wonder 17
I 4330
am 392
glad 30
that 11
you 29
have 11
something 3
of 109
these 4
but 82
now 10
as 509
the 193
first 8
shock 12
is 124
over 596
shall 12
I 4330
own 9
that 11
I 4330
long 49
for 484
your 4
return 14
I 4330
am 392
not 85
so 797
selfish 4
as 509
to 805
press 30
for 484
it 67
if 8
Adieu 3
I 4330
take 18
up 194
my 90
pen 195
to 805
do 814
what 14
I 4330

know 12
my 90
dear 15
uncle 18
and 51
aunt 6
so 797
well 24
that 11
I 4330
am 392
not 85
of 109
it 67
though 12
I 4330
have 11
still 13
something 3
more 11
to 805
ask 6
of 109
the 193
former 3
My 90
father 12
is 124
going 3
to 805
London 5
with 34
Colonel 5

try 12
to 805
discover 10
her 181
What 14
he 962
to 805
do 814
I 4330
am 392
sure 11
I 4330
know 12
not 85
but 82
his 43
distress 7
will 39
not 85
allow 9
him 9
to 805
pursue 6
any 17
measure 8
in 2719
the 193
best 37
and 51
way 27
and 51
Colonel 5

In 2719

exigence 3
my 90

would 5
be 1200
in 2719
the 193

Oh 17

Her 181

pardon 10
but 82
I 4330
must 28
leave 14
you 29
I 4330
must 28
find 10
Mr 5

moment 14
on 86
business 13
that 11
be 1200
I 4330

not 85
an 970
instant 11
to 805
lose 5
Good 28
God 61

is 124
the 193
matter 7

more 11
feeling 4

minute 12

You 29

Elizabeth 5
but 82
her 181
under 288
her 181
and 51
she 199
felt 5
how 27
little 6
would 5
be 1200
by 57
her 181
to 805
pursue 6
them 9
Calling 3
back 182
the 193
servant 3
she 199
him 9
though 12
in 2719
so 797
breathless 4
an 970
accent 14
as 509
made 13
her 181
to 805
fetch 8
his 43
master 28
and 51
mistress 3
home 90
On 86
his 43
the 193
room 22
she 199
sat 92
down 90
to 805
support 10
and 51
so 797
ill 84
that 11
it 67
was 93
for 484
to 805
leave 14
her 181
or 333
to 805
refrain 5
saying 3
in 2719
a 6799
tone 12
of 109
and 51
commiseration 3
Let 50
me 1041
call 57
your 4
maid 19
Is 124
there 21
nothing 5
you 29

to 805
give 15
you 29
present 20
relief 3
A 6799
glass 23
of 109
wine 18
shall 12
I 4330
get 13
you 29
one 19
You 29
are 12
ill 84
No 896
I 4330
thank 15
you 29
she 199
to 805
recover 8
There 21
is 124
nothing 5
the 193
matter 7
with 34
me 1041
I 4330
am 392
well 24
I 4330
am 392
by 57
some 30
dreadful 4
news 71
I 4330
have 11
just 24
She 199
burst 4
into 26
as 509
she 199
to 805
it 67
and 51
for 484
a 6799
few 6
not 85
speak 12
word 26
in 2719
wretched 6
suspense 3
say 7
something 3
of 109
his 43
concern 6
and 51
observe 6
her 181
in 2719
silence 7
At 272
length 14
she 199
spoke 14
I 4330
have 11
just 24
had 11
a 6799
letter 20
Jane 8
with 34
dreadful 4
news 71
It 67
be 1200
My 90
sister 9
has 41
left 19
all 162
her 181
friends 4
has 41
has 41
into 26
the 193
power 19
of 109
of 109
Mr 5
They 5
are 12
gone 4
off 100
together 3
You 29
know 12
him 9
too 50
well 24
to 805
doubt 15
the 193
rest 110
She 199
has 41
no 896
money 17
no 896
nothing 5
that 11
can 287
tempt 14
him 9
to 805
she 199
is 124
for 484
ever 33
was 93
in 2719
When 6
I 4330
consider 13
she 199
in 2719
a 6799
yet 4
more 11
voice 8
that 11
I 4330
might 9
have 11
it 67
I 4330
who 79
what 14
he 962
was 93
Had 11
I 4330
but 82
some 30
part 102
of 109
it 67
some 30
part 102
of 109
what 14
I 4330
to 805
my 90
own 9
Had 11
his 43
character 16
this 6
not 85
have 11
But 82
it 67
is 124
all 162
all 162
too 50
late 23
now 10
I 4330
am 392
But 82
is 124
it 67
certain 5
certain 5
Oh 17
yes 16
They 5
left 19
together 3
on 86
Sunday 3
night 61
and 51
were 5
to 805
London 5
but 82
not 85
they 5
are 12
not 85
gone 4
to 805
And 51
what 14
has 41
done 3
what 14
has 41
to 805
recover 8
her 181
My 90
father 12
is 124
gone 4
to 805
London 5
and 51
Jane 8
has 41
to 805
beg 59
my 90
immediate 4
and 51
we 444
shall 12
be 1200
off 100
I 4330
hope 16
in 2719
half 23
an 970
hour 10
But 82
nothing 5
can 287
be 1200
done 3
I 4330
know 12
well 24
that 11
nothing 5
can 287
be 1200
done 3
How 27
is 124
a 6799
man 342
to 805
be 1200
on 86
How 27
are 12
they 5
even 36
to 805
be 1200
I 4330
have 11
not 85
the 193
hope 16
It 67
is 124
every 10
way 27
horrible 3
his 43
head 140
in 2719
silent 6
When 6
my 90
eyes 8
were 5
to 805
his 43
real 47
character 16
Oh 17
had 11
I 4330
what 14
I 4330
what 14
I 4330
dared 6
to 805
do 814
But 82
I 4330
not 85
I 4330
was 93
of 109
doing 3
too 50
Wretched 6
wretched 6
mistake 5
made 13
no 896
answer 8
He 962
to 805
hear 76
her 181
and 51
was 93
up 194
and 51
down 90
the 193
room 22
in 2719
earnest 8
meditation 3
his 43
brow 40
his 43
air 129
Elizabeth 5
soon 3
and 51
it 67
Her 181
power 19
was 93
must 28
sink 13
under 288
a 6799
proof 11
of 109
weakness 3
an 970
assurance 3
of 109
the 193
disgrace 8
She 199
wonder 17
nor 102
condemn 11
but 82
the 193
belief 3
of 109
his 43
self 11
conquest 3
nothing 5
to 805
her 181
bosom 4
no 896
of 109
her 181
distress 7
It 67
was 93
on 86
the 193
to 805
make 17
her 181
understand 8
her 181
own 9
and 51
never 3
had 11
she 199
so 797
felt 5
that 11
she 199
have 11
him 9
as 509
now 10
when 6
all 162
love 29
must 28
be 1200
vain 8
But 82
self 11
though 12
it 67
would 5
intrude 6
not 85
engross 6
her 181
Lydia 4
the 193
humiliation 3
the 193
she 199
was 93
on 86
them 9
all 162
soon 3
up 194
every 10
private 9
care 47
and 51
covering 3
her 181
face 19
with 34
her 181
handkerchief 3
Elizabeth 5
was 93
soon 3
to 805
and 51
after 48
a 6799
pause 4
of 109
several 3
was 93
to 805
a 6799
sense 8
of 109
her 181
situation 3
by 57
the 193
voice 8
of 109
her 181
companion 10
who 79
in 2719
a 6799
manner 8
though 12
it 67
spoke 14
compassion 4
spoke 14
restraint 3
I 4330
am 392
you 29
have 11
long 49
my 90
absence 3
nor 102
have 11
I 4330
anything 3
to 805
plead 10
in 2719
excuse 4
of 109
my 90
stay 7
but 82
real 47
though 12
concern 6
Would 5
to 805
Heaven 9
that 11
anything 3
be 1200
or 333
done 3
on 86
my 90
part 102
that 11
might 9
offer 10
consolation 3
to 805
distress 7
But 82
I 4330
will 39
not 85
torment 9
you 29
with 34
vain 8
may 49
seem 10
to 805
ask 6
for 484
your 4
thanks 4
This 6
unfortunate 4
affair 3
will 39
I 4330
fear 14
prevent 13
my 90
the 193
pleasure 5
of 109
you 29
at 272
to 805
day 27
Oh 17
yes 16
Be 1200
so 797
kind 31
as 509
to 805
for 484
us 70
to 805
Miss 71
Say 7
that 11
business 13
us 70
home 90
Conceal 10
the 193
truth 7
as 509
long 49
as 509
it 67
is 124
possible 3
I 4330
know 12
it 67
be 1200
long 49
He 962
assured 4
her 181
of 109
his 43
his 43
sorrow 9
for 484
her 181
distress 7
it 67
a 6799
conclusion 3
than 22
there 21
was 93
at 272
present 20
reason 13
to 805
hope 16
and 51
leaving 3
his 43
for 484
her 181
relations 4
with 34
one 19
serious 4
parting 3
look 14
As 509
he 962
the 193
room 22
Elizabeth 5
felt 5
how 27
it 67
was 93
that 11
they 5
should 7
ever 33
see 70
other 5
on 86
of 109
as 509
had 11
several 3
in 2719
and 51
as 509
she 199
a 6799
retrospective 4
glance 4
over 596
the 193
whole 26
of 109
acquaintance 5
so 797
full 16
of 109
and 51
at 272
the 193
of 109
would 5
now 10
have 11
continuance 3
and 51
would 5
have 11
in 2719
termination 3
If 8
and 51
esteem 5
are 12
good 28
of 109
affection 5
change 21
of 109
sentiment 18
will 39
be 1200
nor 102
But 82
if 8
if 8
regard 7
is 124
unreasonable 3
or 333
unnatural 4
in 2719
comparison 3
of 109
what 14
is 124
so 797
often 4
as 509
on 86
a 6799
first 8
interview 11
with 34
object 26
and 51
even 36
two 14
words 5
have 11
nothing 5
can 287
be 1200
in 2719
her 181
except 10
that 11
she 199
had 11
given 3
of 109
a 6799
trial 5
to 805
the 193
latter 3
method 18
in 2719
her 181
for 484
and 51
that 11
ill 84
success 13
might 9
her 181
to 805
seek 6
the 193
other 5
less 19
mode 57
of 109
attachment 3
Be 1200
that 11
as 509
it 67
may 49
she 199
saw 24
him 9
go 500
with 34
regret 9
and 51
in 2719
this 6
example 4
of 109
what 14
must 28
produce 7
found 18
anguish 5
as 509
she 199
on 86
that 11
wretched 6
business 13
Never 3
since 7
reading 3
second 16
letter 20
had 11
she 199
a 6799
hope 16
of 109
meaning 11
to 805
her 181
No 896
one 19
but 82
Jane 8
she 199
thought 11
flatter 10
with 34
an 970
expectation 3
Surprise 4
was 93
the 193
least 3
of 109
her 181
on 86
this 6
development 5
While 4
the 193
of 109
the 193
first 8
letter 20
in 2719
her 181
mind 25
she 199
was 93
all 162
surprise 4
all 162
that 11
should 7
a 6799
girl 14
whom 3
it 67
was 93
he 962
for 484
money 17
and 51
how 27
Lydia 4
ever 33
have 11
him 9
had 11
But 82
now 10
it 67
was 93
all 162
too 50
natural 18
For 484
an 970
attachment 3
as 509
this 6
she 199
might 9
have 11
and 51
though 12
she 199
did 23
not 85
suppose 4
Lydia 4
to 805
be 1200
in 2719
an 970
elopement 3
the 193
intention 5
of 109
marriage 6
she 199
had 11
no 896
in 2719
that 11
her 181
virtue 3
nor 102
her 181
understanding 4
would 5
preserve 7
her 181
an 970
prey 5
She 199
had 11
never 3
while 4
the 193
regiment 8
was 93
in 2719
that 11
Lydia 4
had 11
any 17
for 484
him 9
but 82
she 199
was 93
that 11
Lydia 4
encouragement 3
to 805
attach 10
to 805
one 19
officer 3
had 11
her 181
as 509
them 9
in 2719
her 181
opinion 4
Her 181
had 11
but 82
never 3
an 970
object 26
The 193
of 109
neglect 9
and 51
indulgence 3
a 6799
girl 14
oh 17
how 27
did 23
she 199
now 10
feel 11
it 67
She 199
was 93
wild 36
to 805
be 1200
at 272
home 90
to 805
hear 76
to 805
see 70
to 805
be 1200
the 193
spot 24
to 805
share 22
with 34
Jane 8
in 2719
the 193
cares 6
that 11
must 28
now 10
fall 29
her 181
in 2719
a 6799
so 797
a 6799
father 12
absent 14
a 6799
mother 21
of 109
exertion 3
and 51
constant 7
attendance 3
and 51
though 12
that 11
nothing 5

done 3
for 484
Lydia 4

he 962
the 193
room 22
her 181
impatience 3
was 93
severe 7
Mr 5

had 11
back 182
in 2719
alarm 9
by 57
the 193
account 14
that 11
niece 3
was 93
ill 84
but 82
them 9
on 86
that 11
head 140
she 199
the 193
cause 14
of 109
summons 5
reading 3
the 193

dwelling 3
on 86
the 193
postscript 3

Though 12
Lydia 4
had 11
never 3
a 6799
with 34
them 9
Mr 5
and 51
not 85
but 82
be 1200
Not 85
Lydia 4
but 82
all 162
were 5
in 2719
it 67
and 51
after 48
the 193
first 8
of 109
surprise 4
and 51
horror 3
Mr 5
every 10
in 2719
his 43
power 19
Elizabeth 5
though 12
no 896
less 19
him 9
with 34
of 109
and 51
all 162
three 12
being 3
by 57
one 19
spirit 20
to 805
journey 11
was 93
They 5
were 5
to 805
be 1200
off 100
as 509
soon 3
as 509
possible 3
But 82
what 14
is 124
to 805
be 1200
done 3
John 20
us 70
Mr 5
was 93
here 31
when 6
you 29
sent 35
for 484
us 70
was 93
it 67
so 797
Yes 16
and 51
I 4330
him 9
we 444
should 7
not 85
be 1200
able 3
to 805
keep 11
our 3
engagement 3
That 11
is 124
all 162
What 14
is 124
all 162
the 193
other 5
as 509
she 199
ran 110
into 26
her 181
room 22
to 805
prepare 5
And 51
are 12
they 5
as 509
for 484
her 181
to 805
disclose 3
the 193
real 47
truth 7
Oh 17
that 11
I 4330
how 27
it 67
was 93
But 82
were 5
vain 8
or 333
at 272
least 3
serve 9
to 805
amuse 6
her 181
in 2719
the 193
hurry 3
and 51
confusion 3
of 109
the 193
following 3
hour 10
Had 11
Elizabeth 5
at 272
leisure 8
to 805
be 1200
idle 10
she 199
would 5
have 11
certain 5
that 11
all 162
employment 3
was 93
to 805
one 19
so 797
wretched 6
as 509
but 82
she 199
had 11
her 181
share 22
of 109
business 13
as 509
well 24
as 509
her 181
aunt 6
and 51
the 193
rest 110
there 21
were 5
to 805
be 1200
to 805
all 162
friends 4
at 272
with 34
false 12
for 484
sudden 4
departure 3
An 970
hour 10
saw 24
the 193
whole 26
and 51
Mr 5
his 43
account 14
at 272
the 193
inn 59
nothing 5
to 805
be 1200
done 3
but 82
to 805
go 500
and 51
Elizabeth 5
after 48
all 162
the 193
of 109
the 193
morning 3
found 18
in 2719
a 6799
space 34
of 109
time 45
than 22
she 199
have 11
in 2719
the 193
carriage 5
and 51
on 86
the 193
road 38
to 805
Chapter 3
I 4330
have 11
it 67
over 596
Elizabeth 5
her 181
uncle 18
as 509
they 5
drove 6
the 193
town 27
and 51
serious 4
consideration 3
I 4330
am 392
more 11
than 22
I 4330
was 93
to 805
judge 6
as 509
your 4
sister 9
does 5
on 86
the 193
matter 7
It 67
to 805
me 1041
so 797
that 11
any 17
young 9
man 342
should 7
form 68
a 6799
design 16
a 6799
girl 14
who 79
is 124
by 57
no 896
or 333
and 51
who 79
was 93
in 2719
his 43
that 11
I 4330
am 392
to 805
hope 16
the 193
best 37
he 962
expect 20
that 11
her 181
friends 4
would 5
not 85
step 48
forward 12
he 962
expect 20
to 805
be 1200
by 57
the 193
regiment 8
after 48
an 970
affront 5
to 805
Colonel 5
His 43
temptation 3
is 124
not 85
adequate 4
to 805
the 193
risk 11
Do 814
you 29
think 8
so 797
Elizabeth 5
up 194
for 484
a 6799
moment 14
my 90
word 26
I 4330
begin 8
to 805
be 1200
of 109
your 4
opinion 4
It 67
is 124
too 50
great 12
a 6799
violation 3
of 109
and 51
interest 6
for 484
him 9
to 805
be 1200
of 109
I 4330
think 8
so 797
ill 84
of 109
Can 287
you 29
so 797
give 15
him 9
up 194
as 509
to 805
believe 6
him 9
of 109
it 67
Not 85
of 109
his 43
own 9
interest 6
but 82
of 109
every 10
other 5
neglect 9
I 4330
can 287
believe 6
him 9
If 8
it 67
should 7
be 1200
so 797
But 82
I 4330
dare 15
not 85
hope 16
it 67
Why 4
should 7
they 5
not 85
go 500
on 86
to 805
if 8
that 11
had 11
the 193
case 25
In 2719
the 193
first 8
place 29
Mr 5
there 21
is 124
no 896
absolute 7
proof 11
that 11
they 5
are 12
not 85
gone 4
to 805
Oh 17
but 82
the 193
chaise 3
into 26
a 6799
hackney 5
coach 11
is 124
a 6799
presumption 3
And 51
no 896
of 109
them 9
were 5
to 805
be 1200
found 18
on 86
the 193
road 38
Well 24
then 5
them 9
to 805
be 1200
in 2719
London 5
They 5
may 49
be 1200
there 21
though 12
for 484
the 193
purpose 12
of 109
for 484
no 896
more 11
purpose 12
It 67
is 124
not 85
that 11
money 17
should 7
be 1200
on 86
side 74
and 51
it 67
might 9
strike 14
them 9
that 11
they 5
be 1200
more 11
though 12
less 19
married 3
in 2719
London 5
than 22
in 2719
But 82
why 4
all 162
this 6
Why 4
any 17
fear 14
of 109
Why 4
must 28
marriage 6
be 1200
private 9
Oh 17
no 896
no 896
this 6
is 124
not 85
His 43
most 3
particular 13
friend 14
you 29
see 70
by 57
account 14
was 93
of 109
his 43
never 3
to 805
her 181
will 39
never 3
a 6799
woman 21
some 30
money 17
He 962
afford 6
it 67
And 51
what 14
has 41
Lydia 4
what 14
attraction 3
has 41
she 199
youth 7
health 12
and 51
good 28
that 11
make 17
him 9
for 484
her 181
forego 4
every 10
chance 20
of 109
by 57
well 24
As 509
to 805
what 14
restraint 3
the 193
of 109
disgrace 8
in 2719
the 193
corps 8
might 9
throw 14
on 86
a 6799
elopement 3
with 34
her 181
I 4330
am 392
not 85
able 3
to 805
judge 6
for 484
I 4330
know 12
nothing 5
of 109
the 193
that 11
a 6799
step 48
might 9
produce 7
But 82
as 509
to 805
your 4
other 5
objection 5
I 4330
am 392
it 67
will 39
hold 22
good 28
Lydia 4
has 41
no 896
to 805
step 48
forward 12
and 51
he 962
might 9
imagine 3
my 90
his 43
and 51
the 193
little 6
attention 3
he 962
has 41
ever 33
to 805
give 15
to 805
what 14
was 93
going 3
forward 12
in 2719
his 43
that 11
he 962
would 5
do 814
as 509
little 6
and 51
think 8
as 509
little 6
it 67
as 509
any 17
father 12
do 814
in 2719
a 6799
matter 7
But 82
can 287
you 29
think 8
that 11
Lydia 4
is 124
so 797
to 805
but 82
love 29
of 109
him 9
as 509
to 805
consent 5
to 805
live 43
with 34
him 9
on 86
any 17
other 5
than 22
marriage 6
It 67
does 5
seem 10
and 51
it 67
is 124
most 3
Elizabeth 5
with 34
in 2719
her 181
eyes 8
that 11
a 6799
sense 8
of 109
and 51
virtue 3
in 2719
a 6799
point 22
should 7
admit 7
of 109
doubt 15
But 82
I 4330
know 12
not 85
what 14
to 805
say 7
I 4330
am 392
not 85
doing 3
her 181
justice 3
But 82
she 199
is 124
young 9
she 199
has 41
never 3
to 805
think 8
on 86
serious 4
and 51
for 484
the 193
last 7
half 23
year 19
nay 6
for 484
a 6799
twelvemonth 3
she 199
has 41
given 3
up 194
to 805
nothing 5
but 82
amusement 3
and 51
She 199
has 41
to 805
dispose 6
of 109
her 181
time 45
in 2719
the 193
most 3
idle 10
and 51
frivolous 4
manner 8
and 51
to 805
adopt 12
any 17
that 11
came 36
in 2719
her 181
way 27
Since 7
the 193
shire 3
were 5
first 8
in 2719
nothing 5
but 82
love 29
flirtation 3
and 51
have 11
in 2719
her 181
head 140
She 199
has 41
doing 3
in 2719
her 181
power 19
by 57
and 51
on 86
the 193
subject 11
to 805
give 15
what 14
shall 12
I 4330
call 57
it 67
to 805
her 181
are 12
And 51
we 444
all 162
know 12
that 11
has 41
every 10
charm 14
of 109
person 33
and 51
address 9
that 11
can 287
captivate 3
a 6799
woman 21
But 82
you 29
see 70
that 11
Jane 8
her 181
aunt 6
does 5
not 85
think 8
so 797
ill 84
of 109
as 509
to 805
believe 6
him 9
of 109
the 193
attempt 5
Of 109
whom 3
does 5
Jane 8
ever 33
think 8
ill 84
And 51
who 79
is 124
there 21
might 9
be 1200
former 3
conduct 21
that 11
she 199
would 5
think 8
of 109
an 970
attempt 5
till 14
it 67
were 5
them 9
But 82
Jane 8
as 509
well 24
as 509
I 4330
do 814
what 14
is 124
We 444
both 8
know 12
that 11
he 962
has 41
profligate 4
in 2719
every 10
sense 8
of 109
the 193
word 26
that 11
he 962
has 41
nor 102
that 11
he 962
is 124
as 509
false 12
and 51
deceitful 4
as 509
he 962
is 124
And 51
do 814
you 29
know 12
all 162
this 6
as 509
to 805
the 193
mode 57
of 109
her 181
was 93
all 162
alive 3
I 4330
do 814
Elizabeth 5
I 4330
you 29
the 193
other 5
day 27
of 109
his 43
to 805
Mr 5
and 51
you 29
when 6
last 7
at 272
in 2719
what 14
manner 8
he 962
spoke 14
of 109
the 193
man 342
who 79
had 11
with 34
and 51
him 9
And 51
there 21
are 12
other 5
I 4330
am 392
not 85
at 272
it 67
is 124
not 85
worth 15
while 4
to 805
relate 8
but 82
his 43
the 193
whole 26
are 12
endless 4
what 14
he 962
of 109
Miss 71
I 4330
was 93
prepared 3
to 805
see 70
a 6799
proud 5
reserved 4
disagreeable 3
girl 14
Yet 4
he 962
to 805
the 193
He 962
must 28
know 12
that 11
she 199
was 93
as 509
and 51
as 509
we 444
have 11
found 18
her 181
But 82
does 5
Lydia 4
know 12
nothing 5
of 109
this 6
can 287
she 199
be 1200
of 109
what 14
you 29
and 51
Jane 8
seem 10
so 797
well 24
to 805
understand 8
Oh 17
yes 16
that 11
that 11
is 124
the 193
worst 6
of 109
all 162
Till 14
I 4330
was 93
in 2719
Kent 9
and 51
saw 24
so 797
both 8
of 109
Mr 5
and 51
his 43
relation 7
Colonel 5
I 4330
was 93
of 109
the 193
truth 7
And 51
when 6
I 4330
home 90
the 193
shire 3
was 93
to 805
leave 14
in 2719
a 6799
week 20
or 333
time 45
As 509
that 11
was 93
the 193
case 25
Jane 8
to 805
whom 3
I 4330
related 3
the 193
whole 26
nor 102
I 4330
thought 11
it 67
to 805
make 17
our 3
knowledge 4
public 18
for 484
of 109
what 14
use 18
it 67
be 1200
to 805
any 17
one 19
that 11
the 193
good 28
opinion 4
all 162
the 193
had 11
of 109
him 9
should 7
then 5
be 1200
And 51
even 36
when 6
it 67
was 93
that 11
Lydia 4
should 7
go 500
with 34
the 193
of 109
opening 3
her 181
eyes 8
to 805
his 43
character 16
never 3
to 805
me 1041
That 11
she 199
be 1200
in 2719
any 17
danger 7
the 193

together 3
them 9
as 509
might 9
be 1200
with 34

of 109
regret 9
the 193
conduct 21
of 109
and 51
of 109
her 181
own 9
and 51
ill 84
usage 3
but 82
the 193
person 33
to 805
ill 84
indulgence 3
the 193
of 109
her 181

be 1200
If 8
I 4330
had 11
able 3
she 199

point 22
in 2719
going 3

neglect 9
or 333
other 5
on 86
side 74

in 2719
this 6
business 13
had 11
given 3
more 11
of 109
than 22
usual 3
to 805
the 193
of 109
As 509
for 484
Mary 13
she 199
was 93
mistress 3
of 109
to 805
whisper 8
to 805
Elizabeth 5
with 34
a 6799
countenance 4
of 109
grave 28
reflection 3
soon 3
after 48
they 5
were 5
at 272
table 27
This 6
is 124
a 6799
most 3
unfortunate 4
affair 3
and 51
will 39
be 1200
of 109
But 82
we 444
must 28
stem 8
the 193
tide 15
of 109
and 51
pour 5
into 26
the 193
of 109
other 5
the 193
balm 8
of 109
consolation 3
Then 5
in 2719
Elizabeth 5
no 896
inclination 3
of 109
she 199
as 509
the 193
event 18
must 28
be 1200
for 484
Lydia 4
we 444
may 49
draw 24
it 67
this 6
useful 4
lesson 3
that 11
loss 3
of 109
virtue 3
in 2719
a 6799
female 5
is 124
that 11
one 19
false 12
step 48
her 181
in 2719
endless 4
ruin 10
that 11
her 181
reputation 3
is 124
no 896
less 19
brittle 6
than 22
it 67
is 124
and 51
that 11
she 199
be 1200
too 50
in 2719
her 181
the 193
of 109
the 193
other 5
sex 45
Elizabeth 5
up 194
her 181
eyes 8
in 2719
but 82
was 93
too 50
to 805
make 17
any 17
reply 3
Mary 13
to 805
console 4
with 34
kind 31
of 109
moral 25
the 193
evil 15
them 9
In 2719
the 193
afternoon 3
the 193
two 14
elder 7
Miss 71
were 5
able 3
to 805
be 1200
for 484
half 23
an 970
hour 10
by 57
and 51
Elizabeth 5
of 109
the 193
of 109
making 4
any 17
Jane 8
was 93
eager 6
to 805
satisfy 3
After 48
in 2719
general 22
over 596
the 193
dreadful 4
sequel 3
of 109
this 6
event 18
Elizabeth 5
as 509
all 162
but 82
certain 5
and 51
Miss 71
not 85
assert 11
to 805
be 1200
the 193
former 3
the 193
subject 11
by 57
saying 3
But 82
tell 16
me 1041
all 162
and 51
it 67
I 4330
have 11
not 85
Give 15
me 1041
further 8
What 14
did 23
Colonel 5
say 7
Had 11
they 5
no 896
apprehension 3
of 109
anything 3
the 193
elopement 3
place 29
They 5
must 28
have 11
them 9
together 3
for 484
ever 33
Colonel 5
did 23
own 9
that 11
he 962
had 11
often 4
some 30
on 86
side 74
but 82
nothing 5
to 805
give 15
him 9
any 17
alarm 9
I 4330
am 392
so 797
for 484
him 9
His 43
was 93
attentive 4
and 51
kind 31
to 805
the 193
He 962
was 93
coming 3
to 805
us 70
in 2719
order 11
to 805
assure 6
us 70
of 109
his 43
concern 6
he 962
had 11
any 17
idea 21
of 109
not 85
being 3
gone 4
to 805
when 6
that 11
apprehension 3
first 8
got 14
it 67
his 43
journey 11
And 51
was 93
that 11
would 5
not 85
Did 23
he 962
know 12
of 109
to 805
go 500
off 100
Had 11
Colonel 5
Yes 16
but 82
when 6
by 57
him 9
knowing 3
anything 3
of 109
and 51
would 5
not 85
give 15
his 43
real 47
opinion 4
it 67
He 962
did 23
not 85
repeat 12
his 43
persuasion 3
of 109
not 85
and 51
that 11
I 4330
am 392
to 805
hope 16
he 962
might 9
have 11
And 51
till 14
Colonel 5
came 36
not 85
one 19
of 109
you 29
a 6799
doubt 15
I 4330
suppose 4
of 109
being 3
married 3
How 27
was 93
it 67
possible 3
that 11
an 970
idea 21
should 7
enter 23
our 3
brains 7
I 4330
felt 5
a 6799
little 6
a 6799
little 6
fearful 4
of 109
my 90
with 34
him 9
in 2719
marriage 6
I 4330
that 11
his 43
conduct 21
had 11
not 85
right 31
My 90
father 12
and 51
mother 21
nothing 5
of 109
that 11
they 5
felt 5
how 27
a 6799
match 25
it 67
must 28
be 1200
then 5
with 34
a 6799
natural 18
triumph 10
on 86
knowing 3
more 11
than 22
the 193
rest 110
of 109
us 70
that 11
in 2719
last 7
letter 20
she 199
had 11
prepared 3
her 181
for 484
a 6799
step 48
She 199
had 11
it 67
of 109
being 3
in 2719
love 29
with 34
other 5
But 82
not 85
they 5
to 805
No 896
I 4330
believe 6
not 85
And 51
did 23
Colonel 5
appear 7
to 805
think 8
well 24
of 109
Does 5
he 962
know 12
his 43
real 47
character 16
I 4330
must 28
confess 14
that 11
he 962
did 23
not 85
speak 12
so 797
well 24
of 109
as 509
he 962
did 23
He 962
him 9
to 805
be 1200
and 51
And 51
since 7
this 6
sad 47
affair 3
has 41
place 29
it 67
is 124
that 11
he 962
left 19
in 2719
debt 6
but 82
I 4330
hope 16
this 6
may 49
be 1200
false 12
Oh 17
Jane 8
had 11
we 444
less 19
secret 25
had 11
we 444
what 14
we 444
of 109
him 9
this 6
not 85
have 11
it 67
would 5
have 11
better 7
her 181
sister 9
But 82
to 805
expose 4
the 193
former 3
of 109
any 17
person 33
knowing 3
what 14
present 20
were 5
We 444
with 34
the 193
best 37
Colonel 5
repeat 12
the 193
of 109
note 16
to 805
his 43
wife 6
He 962
it 67
with 34
him 9
for 484
us 70
to 805
see 70
Jane 8
then 5
it 67
her 181
pocket 14
book 69
and 51
gave 4
it 67
to 805
Elizabeth 5
These 4
were 5
the 193
My 90
dear 15
Harriet 4
You 29
will 39
laugh 14
when 6
you 29

and 51
I 4330

at 272
your 4
surprise 4

I 4330
am 392
going 3

Green 57
and 51
if 8
you 29
guess 16
with 34
who 79
I 4330
shall 12
think 8
you 29
a 6799
simpleton 3
for 484
there 21
is 124
but 82
one 19
man 342
in 2719
the 193
world 12
I 4330
love 29
and 51
he 962
is 124
an 970
angel 27
I 4330
should 7
never 3
be 1200
him 9
so 797
think 8
it 67
no 896
harm 41
to 805
be 1200
off 100
You 29

my 90

if 8

not 85
like 22
it 67
for 484
it 67
will 39
make 17
the 193
surprise 4
the 193
when 6
I 4330

Pray 9

engagement 3
and 51
with 34
him 9
to 805
night 61
Tell 16
him 9
I 4330
hope 16
he 962
will 39
excuse 4
me 1041
when 6
he 962
all 162
and 51

we 444
meet 9
with 34
great 12
pleasure 5
I 4330
shall 12
send 10

my 90

when 6
I 4330

Good 28

Give 15

to 805
our 3
good 28
journey 11
Your 4
friend 14
LYDIA 4
Oh 17
thoughtless 4
thoughtless 4
Lydia 4
Elizabeth 5
when 6
she 199
had 11
it 67
What 14
a 6799
letter 20
is 124
this 6
to 805
be 1200
at 272
a 6799
moment 14
But 82
at 272
least 3
it 67
shows 5
that 11
she 199
was 93
serious 4
on 86
the 193
subject 11
of 109
journey 11
he 962
might 9
persuade 6
her 181
to 805
it 67
was 93
not 85
on 86
her 181
side 74
a 6799
scheme 7
of 109
My 90
poor 11
father 12
how 27
he 962
must 28
have 11
felt 5
it 67
I 4330
never 3
saw 24
so 797
He 962
not 85
speak 12
a 6799
word 26
for 484
full 16
ten 151
My 90
mother 21
was 93
ill 84
and 51
the 193
whole 26
house 87
in 2719
confusion 3
Oh 17
Jane 8
Elizabeth 5
was 93
there 21
a 6799
servant 3
belonging 3
to 805
it 67
who 79
did 23
not 85
know 12
the 193
whole 26
story 13
the 193
end 92
of 109
the 193
day 27
I 4330
do 814
not 85
know 12
I 4330
hope 16
there 21
was 93
But 82
to 805
be 1200
at 272
a 6799
time 45
is 124
difficult 5
My 90
mother 21
was 93
in 2719
and 51
though 12
I 4330
to 805
give 15
her 181
every 10
in 2719
my 90
power 19
I 4330
am 392
I 4330
did 23
not 85
do 814
so 797
as 509
I 4330
might 9
have 11
done 3
But 82
the 193
horror 3
of 109
what 14
might 9
happen 9
me 1041
my 90
Your 4
attendance 3
her 181
has 41
too 50
for 484
you 29
You 29
do 814
not 85
look 14
well 24
Oh 17
that 11
I 4330
had 11
with 34
you 29
you 29
have 11
had 11
every 10
care 47
and 51
Mary 13
and 51
have 11
kind 31
and 51
would 5
have 11
in 2719
every 10
fatigue 5
I 4330
am 392
sure 11
but 82
I 4330
did 23
not 85
think 8
it 67
right 31
for 484
of 109
them 9
is 124
slight 10
and 51
delicate 7
and 51
Mary 13
so 797
that 11
her 181
of 109
repose 5
should 7
not 85
be 1200
broken 6
in 2719
on 86
My 90
aunt 6
came 36
to 805
on 86
Tuesday 3
after 48
my 90
father 12
and 51

so 797
good 28
as 509
to 805
stay 7
till 14
Thursday 3
with 34
me 1041
She 199
was 93
of 109
great 12
use 18
and 51
comfort 14
to 805
us 70
all 162
And 51
Lady 18
has 41
kind 31
she 199
here 31
on 86
Wednesday 3
morning 3
to 805
condole 6
with 34
us 70
and 51
her 181
or 333
any 17
of 109
her 181
if 8
they 5
should 7
be 1200
of 109
use 18
to 805
us 70
She 199
had 11
better 7
have 11
at 272
home 90
Elizabeth 5
she 199
meant 3
well 24
but 82
under 288
a 6799
misfortune 3
as 509
this 6
one 19
see 70
too 50
little 6
of 109
is 124
condolence 3
Let 50
them 9
triumph 10
over 596
us 70
at 272
a 6799
distance 4
and 51
be 1200
She 199
then 5
to 805
inquire 6
into 26
the 193
her 181
father 12
had 11
intended 3
to 805
pursue 6
while 4
in 2719
town 27
for 484
the 193
of 109
his 43
daughter 4
He 962
meant 3
I 4330
believe 6
Jane 8
to 805
go 500
to 805
the 193
place 29
where 21
they 5
last 7
horses 7
see 70
the 193
and 51
try 12
if 8
anything 3
be 1200
made 13
out 365
them 9
His 43
principal 7
object 26
must 28
be 1200
to 805
discover 10
the 193
number 8
of 109
the 193
hackney 5
coach 11
them 9
It 67
had 11
come 36
with 34
a 6799
fare 7
London 5
and 51
as 509

thought 11
that 11
the 193
circumstance 4
of 109
a 6799
gentleman 3
and 51
one 19
carriage 5
into 26

be 1200
he 962
meant 3
to 805
make 17
at 272
If 8
he 962
discover 10
at 272
what 14
house 87
the 193

set 40
down 90
his 43
fare 7
he 962
to 805
make 17
there 21
and 51
it 67
might 9
not 85

to 805
find 10
out 365
the 193
stand 42
and 51
number 8
of 109
the 193
coach 11
I 4330
do 814
not 85
know 12
of 109
any 17
other 5
that 11
he 962
had 11
but 82
he 962
was 93
in 2719
a 6799
hurry 3
to 805

gone 4

The 193

a 6799

Mr 5
the 193
morning 3
but 82

at 272
a 6799
time 45
they 5
had 11
for 484
exertion 3
They 5
were 5
to 805
conclude 3
that 11
he 962
had 11
no 896
pleasing 3
to 805
send 10
but 82
even 36

certain 5
Mr 5

When 6

his 43

it 67
as 509

She 199
in 2719

the 193

up 194

she 199
never 3

some 30
fresh 22
instance 4
of 109
extravagance 3
or 333
she 199
leaving 3

she 199
found 18

All 162

the 193
man 342
who 79
but 82

certain 5
and 51
even 36
Jane 8
who 79
still 13
less 19
of 109
it 67
hopeless 4
more 11
as 509
the 193
time 45
was 93
now 10
come 36
when 6
if 8
they 5
had 11
gone 4
to 805
she 199
had 11
never 3

all 162
have 11
some 30
news 71

Mr 5
left 19
on 86
Sunday 3
on 86
Tuesday 3
his 43

a 6799
letter 20
him 9
it 67
them 9
that 11
on 86
his 43
arrival 3
he 962
had 11
found 18

him 9

Mr 5
had 11
to 805

his 43
arrival 3
but 82
any 17
information 3
and 51
that 11
he 962
was 93
now 10
to 805
inquire 6
at 272
all 162
the 193
principal 7
in 2719
town 27
as 509
Mr 5
thought 11
it 67
possible 3
they 5
might 9
have 11
gone 4
to 805
one 19
of 109
them 9
on 86
first 8
coming 3
to 805
London 5
they 5
Mr 5
did 23
not 85
expect 20
any 17
success 13
this 6
measure 8
but 82
as 509
his 43
brother 9
was 93
eager 6
in 2719
it 67
he 962
meant 3
to 805
assist 10
him 9
in 2719
it 67
He 962
that 11
Mr 5
at 272
present 20
to 805
leave 14
London 5
and 51
to 805
write 5
soon 3
There 21
was 93
also 3
a 6799
postscript 3
to 805
this 6
effect 15
I 4330
have 11
to 805
Colonel 5
to 805
desire 6
him 9
to 805
find 10
out 365
if 8
possible 3
some 30
of 109
the 193
young 9
in 2719
the 193
regiment 8
has 41
any 17
relations 4
or 333
who 79
would 5
be 1200
to 805
know 12
in 2719
what 14
part 102
of 109
town 27
he 962
has 41
now 10
If 8
there 21
were 5
that 11
one 19
to 805
with 34
a 6799
of 109
a 6799
clue 5
as 509
that 11
it 67
might 9
be 1200
of 109
essential 4
consequence 3
At 272
present 20
we 444
have 11
nothing 5
to 805
guide 16
us 70
Colonel 5
will 39
I 4330
dare 15
say 7
do 814
in 2719
his 43
power 19
to 805
satisfy 3
us 70
on 86
this 6
head 140
But 82
on 86
second 16
tell 16
us 70
what 14
relations 4
he 962
has 41
now 10
living 5
better 7
than 22
any 17
other 5
person 33
Elizabeth 5
was 93
at 272
no 896
loss 3
to 805
understand 8
this 6
to 805
her 181
but 82
it 67
was 93
not 85
in 2719
her 181
power 19
to 805
give 15
any 17
information 3
of 109
so 797
a 6799
nature 3
as 509
the 193
compliment 6
She 199
had 11
never 3
of 109
his 43
had 11
any 17
relations 4
except 10
a 6799
father 12
and 51
mother 21
both 8
of 109
whom 3
had 11
dead 39
It 67
was 93
possible 3
that 11
some 30
of 109
his 43
companions 3
in 2719
the 193
shire 3
might 9
be 1200
able 3
to 805
give 15
more 11
information 3
and 51
though 12
she 199
was 93
not 85
in 2719
it 67
the 193
application 3
was 93
a 6799
something 3
to 805
look 14
forward 12
to 805
Every 10
day 27
at 272
was 93
now 10
a 6799
day 27
of 109
but 82
the 193
most 3
anxious 4
part 102
of 109
was 93
when 6
the 193
post 113
was 93
The 193
arrival 3
of 109
was 93
the 193
grand 74
object 26
of 109
every 10
impatience 3
Through 4
of 109
good 28
or 333
bad 33
was 93
to 805
be 1200
would 5
be 1200
and 51
every 10
day 27
was 93
to 805
bring 6
some 30
news 71
of 109
But 82
they 5
Mr 5
a 6799
letter 20
for 484
father 12
a 6799
different 11
quarter 25
Mr 5
as 509
Jane 8
had 11
to 805
open 21
all 162
that 11
came 36
for 484
him 9
in 2719
his 43
absence 3
she 199
read 49
and 51
Elizabeth 5
who 79
what 14
his 43
were 5
over 596
her 181
and 51
read 49
it 67
It 67
was 93
as 509
My 90
dear 15
Sir 22
I 4330
feel 11
by 57
our 3
relationship 3
and 51
my 90
situation 3
in 2719
life 44
to 805
condole 6
with 34
you 29
on 86
the 193
grievous 4
affliction 3
you 29
are 12
now 10
suffering 3
under 288
of 109
we 444
were 5
yesterday 3
by 57
a 6799
letter 20
Be 1200
assured 4
my 90
dear 15
sir 22
that 11
and 51
with 34
you 29
and 51
all 162
your 4
in 2719
your 4
present 20
distress 7
must 28
be 1200
of 109
the 193
kind 31
proceeding 3
a 6799
cause 14
no 896
time 45
can 287
remove 7
No 896
shall 12
be 1200
on 86
my 90
part 102
that 11
can 287
alleviate 3
so 797
severe 7
a 6799
misfortune 3
or 333
that 11
may 49
comfort 14
you 29
under 288
a 6799
circumstance 4
that 11
must 28
be 1200
of 109
all 162
the 193
most 3
to 805
a 6799
mind 25
The 193
death 19
of 109
your 4
daughter 4
would 5
have 11
a 6799
blessing 3
in 2719
comparison 3
of 109
this 6
And 51
it 67
is 124
the 193
more 11
to 805
be 1200
there 21
is 124
reason 13
to 805
suppose 4
as 509
my 90
dear 15
Charlotte 4
me 1041
that 11
this 6
of 109
in 2719
your 4
daughter 4
has 41
a 6799
degree 3
of 109
indulgence 3
though 12
at 272
the 193
same 5
time 45
for 484
the 193
consolation 3
of 109
and 51
I 4330
am 392
to 805
think 8
that 11
her 181
own 9
disposition 3
must 28
be 1200
bad 33
or 333
she 199
not 85
be 1200
of 109
an 970
at 272
so 797
an 970
age 24
that 11
may 49
be 1200
you 29
are 12
to 805
be 1200
in 2719
opinion 4
I 4330
am 392
not 85
by 57
but 82
by 57
Lady 18
and 51
her 181
daughter 4
to 805
whom 3
I 4330
have 11
related 3
the 193
affair 3
They 5
agree 11
with 34
me 1041
in 2719
that 11
this 6
false 12
step 48
in 2719
one 19
daughter 4
will 39
be 1200
to 805
the 193
of 109
all 162
the 193
for 484
who 79
as 509
Lady 18
will 39
connect 18
with 34
a 6799
And 51
this 6
consideration 3
me 1041
to 805
reflect 12
with 34
satisfaction 3
on 86
a 6799
certain 5
event 18
of 109
last 7
November 3
for 484
had 11
it 67
I 4330
must 28
have 11
in 2719
all 162
your 4
sorrow 9
and 51
disgrace 8
Let 50
me 1041
then 5
advise 9
you 29
dear 15
sir 22
to 805
console 4
as 509
as 509
possible 3
to 805
throw 14
off 100
your 4
child 28
your 4
affection 5
for 484
ever 33
and 51
leave 14
her 181
to 805
reap 40
the 193
of 109
her 181
own 9
heinous 4
offense 3
I 4330
am 392
dear 15
sir 22
etc 10
etc 10
Mr 5
did 23
not 85
write 5
till 14
he 962
had 11
an 970
answer 8
Colonel 5
and 51
then 5
he 962
had 11
nothing 5
of 109
a 6799
pleasant 9
nature 3
to 805
send 10
It 67
was 93
not 85
that 11
had 11
a 6799
single 15
relationship 3
with 34
whom 3
he 962
up 194
any 17
connection 3
and 51
it 67
was 93
certain 5
that 11
he 962
had 11
no 896
near 15
one 19
living 5
His 43
former 3
acquaintances 3
had 11
but 82
since 7
he 962
had 11
in 2719
the 193
militia 6
it 67
did 23
not 85
appear 7
that 11
he 962
was 93
on 86
of 109
particular 13
friendship 3
with 34
any 17
of 109
them 9
There 21
was 93
no 896
one 19
who 79
be 1200
out 365
as 509
to 805
give 15
any 17
news 71
of 109
him 9
And 51
in 2719
the 193
wretched 6
state 41
of 109
his 43
own 9
there 21
was 93
a 6799

I 4330
had 11
no 896
hesitation 3

far 91
as 509
I 4330
thought 11
for 484
you 29
I 4330
shall 12
send 10
this 6
by 57
express 25

You 29
will 39
comprehend 4
these 4
that 11
Mr 5

not 85
so 797
hopeless 4
as 509
they 5
are 12
to 805
be 1200
The 193
world 12
has 41
in 2719
that 11
respect 18
and 51
I 4330
am 392
to 805
say 7
there 21

some 30
little 6

when 6
all 162
his 43

settle 10
on 86
my 90
niece 3
in 2719
addition 5
to 805
her 181
own 9
fortune 8
If 8
as 509
I 4330
conclude 3
will 39
be 1200
the 193
case 25
you 29
send 10
me 1041

will 39
give 15
to 805

a 6799
proper 9
settlement 3
There 21
will 39
not 85

the 193
occasion 7
for 484
your 4

my 90

Send 10
back 182
your 4
answer 8
as 509
fast 29
as 509
you 29
can 287
and 51
be 1200
careful 6
to 805
write 5
We 444
have 11
it 67
best 37
that 11
my 90
niece 3

married 3
this 6
house 87
of 109

hope 16
you 29
will 39
approve 3
She 199
comes 4
to 805
us 70
to 805
day 27
I 4330
shall 12
write 5

anything 3
more 11
is 124

Yours 3
etc 10
EDW 10
Is 124
it 67
possible 3
Elizabeth 5
when 6
she 199
had 11
Can 287
it 67
be 1200
possible 3
that 11
he 962
will 39
her 181
is 124
not 85
so 797
then 5
as 509
we 444
thought 11
him 9
her 181
sister 9
My 90
dear 15
father 12
I 4330
congratulate 3
you 29

must 28
be 1200
done 3
soon 3
Most 3
did 23
she 199
then 5
entreat 8
him 9
to 805
lose 5
no 896
more 11
time 45
he 962
Oh 17
my 90
dear 15
father 12
she 199
come 36
back 182
and 51
write 5
Consider 13
how 27
every 10
moment 14

in 2719
a 6799
case 25
Let 50
me 1041
write 5
for 484
you 29
Jane 8
if 8
you 29
dislike 4
the 193
trouble 18
I 4330
dislike 4
it 67
he 962
but 82
it 67
must 28
be 1200
done 3
And 51
so 797
saying 3
he 962
back 182
with 34
them 9
and 51
the 193
house 87
And 51
may 49
I 4330
ask 6
Elizabeth 5
but 82
the 193
I 4330
suppose 4
must 28
be 1200
with 34
with 34
I 4330
am 392
of 109
his 43
so 797
little 6
And 51
they 5
must 28
Yet 4
he 962
is 124
a 6799
man 342
Yes 16
yes 16
they 5
must 28
There 21
is 124
nothing 5
to 805
be 1200
done 3
But 82
there 21
are 12
two 14
that 11
I 4330
want 13
to 805
know 12
one 19
is 124
how 27
money 17
your 4
uncle 18

down 90
to 805
bring 6
it 67
and 51
the 193
other 5
how 27
am 392
I 4330

to 805
pay 52
him 9
Money 17
My 90
uncle 18
Jane 8
what 14
do 814
you 29

sir 22
I 4330
mean 36
that 11
no 896
man 342
in 2719
his 43
would 5
Lydia 4
on 86
so 797
slight 10
a 6799
temptation 3
as 509
one 19
hundred 10
a 6799
year 19
my 90
life 44
and 51
after 48
I 4330
am 392
gone 4
That 11
is 124
true 9
Elizabeth 5
though 12
it 67
had 11
not 85
to 805
me 1041
His 43
to 805
be 1200
and 51
something 3
still 13
to 805
remain 9
Oh 17
it 67
must 28
be 1200
my 90
Generous 4
good 28
man 342
I 4330
am 392
he 962
has 41
A 6799
small 14
sum 70
not 85
do 814
all 162
this 6
No 896
her 181
father 12
a 6799
fool 21
if 8
he 962
her 181
with 34
a 6799
farthing 3
less 19
than 22
ten 151
thousand 7
I 4330
should 7
be 1200
to 805
think 8
so 797
ill 84
of 109
him 9
in 2719
the 193
beginning 3
of 109
our 3
relationship 3
Ten 151
thousand 7
Heaven 9
forbid 6
How 27
is 124
half 23
a 6799
sum 70
to 805
be 1200
Mr 5
made 13
no 896
answer 8
and 51
of 109
them 9
deep 12
in 2719
thought 11
silent 6
till 14
they 5
the 193
house 87
father 12
then 5
on 86
to 805
the 193
to 805
write 5
and 51
the 193
into 26
the 193
breakfast 5
room 22
And 51
they 5
are 12
to 805
be 1200
married 3
Elizabeth 5
as 509
soon 3
as 509
they 5
were 5
by 57
How 27
strange 8
this 6
is 124
And 51
for 484
this 6
we 444
are 12
to 805
be 1200
thankful 4
That 11
they 5
should 7
small 14
as 509
is 124
chance 20
of 109
and 51
wretched 6
as 509
is 124
his 43
character 16
we 444
are 12
to 805
rejoice 3
Oh 17
Lydia 4
I 4330
comfort 14
with 34
Jane 8
that 11
he 962
would 5
not 85
Lydia 4
if 8
he 962
had 11
not 85
a 6799
real 47
regard 7
for 484
her 181
Though 12
our 3
kind 31
uncle 18
has 41
done 3
something 3
clearing 6
him 9
I 4330
believe 6
that 11
ten 151
thousand 7
or 333
anything 3
like 22
it 67
has 41
He 962
has 41
of 109
his 43
own 9
and 51
may 49
have 11
more 11
How 27
he 962
spare 11
half 23
ten 151
thousand 7
If 8
he 962
were 5
ever 33
able 3
to 805
learn 9
what 14
have 11
Elizabeth 5
and 51
how 27
is 124
on 86
his 43
side 74
on 86
our 3
sister 9
we 444
shall 12
know 12
what 14
Mr 5
has 41
done 3
for 484
them 9
has 41
not 85
sixpence 3
of 109
his 43
own 9
The 193
kindness 3
of 109
my 90
uncle 18
and 51
aunt 6
can 287
never 3
be 1200
taking 4
her 181
home 90
and 51
her 181
personal 13
protection 8
and 51
countenance 4
is 124
a 6799
sacrifice 4
to 805
her 181
advantage 6
as 509
of 109
acknowledge 3
By 57
this 6
time 45
she 199
is 124
with 34
them 9
If 8
does 5
not 85
make 17
her 181
miserable 3
now 10
she 199
will 39
never 3
deserve 4
to 805
be 1200
What 14
a 6799
meeting 6
for 484
her 181
when 6
she 199
first 8
sees 6
my 90
aunt 6
We 444
must 28
to 805
forget 8
all 162
that 11
has 41
on 86
side 74
Jane 8
I 4330
hope 16
and 51
trust 26
they 5
will 39
yet 4
be 1200
His 43
to 805
her 181
is 124
a 6799
proof 11
I 4330
will 39
believe 6
that 11
he 962
is 124
come 36
to 805
a 6799
right 31
way 27
of 109
mutual 4
affection 5
will 39
steady 3
them 9
and 51
I 4330
flatter 10
they 5
will 39
settle 10
so 797
and 51
live 43
in 2719
so 797
rational 22
a 6799
manner 8
as 509
may 49
in 2719
time 45
make 17
past 71
conduct 21
has 41
Elizabeth 5
as 509
you 29
nor 102
I 4330
nor 102
can 287
ever 33
forget 8
It 67
is 124
useless 4
to 805
talk 18
of 109
it 67
It 67
now 10
to 805
the 193
that 11
mother 21
was 93
in 2719
all 162
likelihood 3
of 109
what 14
had 11
They 5
to 805
the 193
and 51
father 12
he 962
would 5
not 85
wish 13
them 9
to 805
make 17
it 67
to 805
her 181
He 962
was 93
writing 3
and 51
his 43
head 140
Just 24
as 509
you 29
please 3
May 49

with 34
one 19
communication 3

After 48

To 805

He 962

not 85
as 509
the 193
most 3

but 82
while 4
he 962
was 93
mortal 6
there 21
must 28
be 1200
a 6799
triumph 10
She 199
now 10
to 805
comprehend 4
that 11
he 962
was 93
the 193
man 342
who 79
in 2719
disposition 3
and 51
would 5
most 3
suit 21
her 181
His 43
understanding 4
and 51
temper 22
though 12
unlike 10
her 181
own 9
would 5
have 11
all 162
her 181
It 67
was 93
an 970
union 14
that 11

the 193
advantage 6
of 109

by 57
her 181
ease 10
and 51
his 43
mind 25
might 9
have 11
his 43

his 43
information 3
and 51
knowledge 4
of 109
the 193
world 12
she 199
must 28
have 11
benefit 5
of 109
But 82
no 896
marriage 6
now 10
teach 9
the 193
multitude 3
what 14
was 93
An 970
union 14
of 109
a 6799
different 11
and 51
the 193
of 109
the 193
other 5
was 93
soon 3
to 805
be 1200
in 2719
How 27
and 51
Lydia 4
were 5
to 805
be 1200
in 2719
she 199
not 85
imagine 3
But 82
how 27
little 6
of 109
permanent 4
belong 6
to 805
a 6799
couple 7
who 79
were 5
together 3

virtue 3
she 199
conjecture 4
Mr 5
soon 3
to 805
his 43
brother 9
To 805
Mr 5
he 962
with 34
assurance 3
of 109
his 43

promote 6
the 193
of 109
any 17
of 109
his 43

with 34
that 11
the 193
subject 11
might 9
never 3
be 1200
to 805
him 9
The 193
principal 7
purport 6
of 109
his 43
letter 20
was 93
to 805
inform 21
them 9
that 11
Mr 5

my 90
wish 13
that 11
he 962
should 7
do 814
so 797
he 962
as 509
soon 3
as 509
his 43
marriage 6
was 93
on 86
And 51
I 4330

in 2719
the 193
removal 3

still 13
some 30
who 79
are 12
able 3
and 51
willing 4
to 805
assist 10
him 9
in 2719
the 193
He 962
has 41
the 193
promise 4
of 109
an 970
in 2719
General 22
regiment 8
now 10
in 2719

advantage 6

this 6
part 102
of 109
the 193

a 6799
character 16
to 805

will 39
both 8
be 1200
more 11
prudent 5

have 11
to 805
Colonel 5

of 109
Mr 5

And 51

you 29

They 5

then 5
join 16
his 43

my 90

I 4330
do 814
not 85
like 22
your 4
way 27
of 109
were 5
not 85
to 805
remain 9
above 3
ten 151
with 34
them 9
Mr 5
had 11
his 43
commission 10
he 962
left 19
London 5
and 51
he 962
was 93
to 805
join 16
his 43
regiment 8
at 272
the 193
end 92
of 109
a 6799
fortnight 4
No 896
one 19
but 82
that 11
stay 7
would 5
be 1200
so 797
short 62
and 51
she 199
made 13
the 193
most 3
of 109
the 193
time 45
by 57
with 34
her 181
daughter 4
and 51
frequent 9
at 272
home 90
These 4
were 5
acceptable 3
to 805
all 162
to 805
avoid 8
a 6799
circle 7
was 93
even 36
more 11
desirable 3
to 805
as 509
did 23
think 8
than 22
as 509
did 23
not 85
affection 5
for 484
Lydia 4
was 93
just 24
what 14
Elizabeth 5
had 11
to 805
find 10
it 67
not 85
equal 17
to 805
for 484
him 9
She 199
had 11
her 181
present 20
observation 4
to 805
be 1200
the 193
reason 13
of 109
that 11
elopement 3
had 11
on 86
by 57
the 193
strength 10
of 109
her 181
love 29
than 22
by 57
his 43
and 51
she 199
would 5
have 11
why 4
for 484
her 181
he 962
to 805
elope 6
with 34
her 181
at 272
all 162
had 11
she 199
not 85
felt 5
certain 5
that 11
his 43
flight 9
was 93
by 57
distress 7
of 109
and 51
if 8
that 11
were 5
the 193
case 25
he 962
was 93
not 85
the 193
young 9
man 342
to 805
resist 17
an 970
of 109
a 6799
companion 10
Lydia 4
was 93
fond 17
of 109
him 9
He 962
was 93
her 181
dear 15
on 86
every 10
occasion 7
no 896
one 19
was 93
to 805
be 1200
put 47
in 2719
competition 3
with 34
him 9
He 962
did 23
every 10
thing 15
best 37
in 2719
the 193
world 12
and 51
she 199
was 93
sure 11
he 962
would 5
kill 16
more 11
birds 6
on 86
the 193
first 8
of 109
September 3
than 22
any 17
body 15
in 2719
the 193
country 12
One 19
morning 3
soon 3
after 48
arrival 3
as 509
she 199
was 93
sitting 3
with 34
her 181
two 14
elder 7

to 805
Elizabeth 5
I 4330
never 3
gave 4
you 29
an 970
account 14
of 109
my 90
wedding 3
I 4330
believe 6
You 29

when 6
I 4330
mamma 9
and 51
the 193

No 896
Elizabeth 5
I 4330
think 8
there 21
be 1200
too 50
little 6
on 86
the 193
subject 11
La 977
You 29
are 12
so 797
strange 8
But 82
I 4330
must 28
tell 16
you 29
how 27
it 67
off 100
We 444
were 5
married 3
you 29
know 12
at 272
St 1910
were 5
in 2719
that 11
parish 6
And 51
it 67
was 93
that 11
we 444
should 7
all 162
be 1200
there 21
by 57
eleven 7
My 90
uncle 18
and 51
aunt 6
and 51
I 4330
were 5
to 805
go 500
together 3
and 51
the 193
were 5
to 805
meet 9
us 70
at 272
the 193
church 21
Well 24
Monday 3
morning 3
came 36
and 51
I 4330
was 93
in 2719
a 6799
fuss 17
I 4330
was 93
so 797
you 29
know 12
that 11
something 3
would 5
happen 9
to 805
put 47
it 67
off 100
and 51
then 5
I 4330
should 7
have 11
gone 4
And 51
there 21
was 93
my 90
aunt 6
all 162
the 193
time 45
I 4330
was 93
dressing 3
and 51
just 24
as 509
if 8
she 199
was 93
reading 3
a 6799
sermon 7
I 4330
did 23
not 85
hear 76
above 3
one 19
word 26
in 2719
ten 151
for 484
I 4330
was 93
you 29
may 49
suppose 4
of 109
my 90
dear 15
I 4330
to 805
know 12
he 962
would 5
be 1200
married 3
in 2719
his 43
blue 61
coat 12
Well 24
and 51
so 797
we 444
at 272
ten 151
as 509
usual 3
I 4330
thought 11
it 67
would 5
never 3
be 1200
over 596
for 484
by 57
the 193
bye 5
you 29
are 12
to 805
understand 8
that 11
my 90
uncle 18
and 51
aunt 6
were 5
unpleasant 4
all 162
the 193
time 45
I 4330
was 93
with 34
them 9
If 8
believe 6
me 1041
I 4330
did 23
not 85
put 47
my 90
foot 79
out 365
of 109
doors 9
though 12
I 4330
was 93
there 21
a 6799
fortnight 4
Not 85
one 19
party 3
or 333
scheme 7
or 333

To 805
be 1200
sure 11
London 5
was 93
thin 35
but 82
the 193
Little 6
was 93
open 21
Well 24
and 51
so 797
just 24
as 509
the 193
carriage 5
came 36
to 805
the 193
door 41
my 90
uncle 18
was 93

And 51

when 6

get 13
together 3
there 21

of 109
it 67
Well 24

then 5
we 444

Street 15
Sept 21
My 90
dear 15
Niece 3
I 4330
have 11
just 24
your 4
letter 20
and 51
shall 12
devote 7
this 6
whole 26
morning 3
to 805
it 67
as 509
I 4330
foresee 8
that 11
a 6799
little 6
writing 3
will 39
not 85
comprise 3
what 14
I 4330
have 11
to 805
tell 16
you 29
I 4330
must 28
confess 14
by 57
your 4
application 3
I 4330
did 23
not 85
expect 20
it 67
you 29
think 8
me 1041
for 484
I 4330
mean 36
to 805
let 50
you 29
know 12
that 11
I 4330
had 11
not 85
to 805
be 1200
on 86
your 4
side 74
If 8
you 29
do 814
not 85
choose 5
to 805
understand 8
me 1041
forgive 8
my 90
impertinence 3
Your 4
uncle 18
is 124
as 509
as 509
I 4330
am 392
and 51
nothing 5
but 82
the 193
belief 3
of 109
your 4
being 3
a 6799
party 3
would 5
have 11
him 9
to 805
act 69
as 509
he 962
has 41
done 3
But 82
if 8
you 29
are 12
innocent 4
and 51
I 4330
must 28
be 1200
more 11
explicit 4
On 86
the 193
day 27
of 109
my 90
coming 3
home 90
your 4
uncle 18
had 11
a 6799
most 3
unexpected 4
visitor 3
Mr 5
and 51
was 93
shut 32
up 194
with 34
him 9
several 3
It 67
was 93
all 162
over 596
I 4330
so 797
my 90
was 93
not 85
so 797
as 509
yours 3
to 805
have 11
He 962
came 36
to 805
tell 16
Mr 5
that 11
he 962
had 11
found 18
out 365
where 21
your 4
sister 9
and 51
Mr 5
were 5
and 51
that 11
he 962
had 11
and 51
with 34
them 9
both 8
Lydia 4
what 14
I 4330
can 287
collect 30
he 962
left 19
one 19
day 27
after 48
and 51
came 36
to 805
town 27
with 34
the 193
resolution 3
of 109
hunting 4
for 484
them 9
The 193
motive 4
was 93
his 43
conviction 3
of 109
being 3
to 805
that 11
had 11
not 85
so 797
well 24
as 509
to 805
make 17
it 67
for 484
any 17
young 9
woman 21
of 109
character 16
to 805
love 29
or 333
confide 15
in 2719
him 9
He 962
the 193
whole 26
to 805
his 43
pride 6
and 51
that 11
he 962
had 11
thought 11
it 67
him 9
to 805
lay 42
his 43
private 9
open 21
to 805
the 193
world 12
His 43
character 16
was 93
to 805
speak 12
for 484
He 962
it 67
his 43
to 805
step 48
forward 12
and 51
to 805
remedy 3
an 970
evil 15
had 11
on 86
by 57
If 8
he 962
had 11
motive 4
I 4330
am 392
sure 11
it 67
would 5
never 3
disgrace 8
him 9
He 962
had 11
some 30
in 2719
town 27
he 962
was 93
able 3
to 805
discover 10
them 9
but 82
he 962
had 11
something 3
to 805
direct 30
his 43
search 12
was 93
more 11
than 22
we 444
had 11
and 51
the 193
consciousness 3
of 109
this 6
was 93
reason 13
for 484
his 43
to 805
follow 11
us 70
There 21
is 124
a 6799
lady 18
it 67
a 6799
who 79
was 93
some 30
time 45
ago 15
governess 3
to 805
Miss 71
and 51
was 93
her 181
charge 8
on 86
some 30
cause 14
of 109
though 12
he 962
did 23
not 85
say 7
what 14
She 199

since 7
by 57
This 6
was 93
he 962

of 109
him 9
as 509
soon 3
as 509
he 962
got 14
to 805
town 27
But 82

two 14
or 333
three 12
he 962
get 13
her 181
what 14
he 962
She 199
would 5
not 85
betray 10
her 181
trust 26
I 4330
suppose 4
and 51
corruption 3
for 484
she 199
did 23
know 12
where 21
her 181
friend 14
was 93
to 805

gone 4
to 805

in 2719
London 5
and 51
had 11
she 199
able 3
to 805
receive 8
them 9
into 26
her 181
house 87
they 5
would 5
have 11
up 194
abode 3
with 34
her 181
At 272
length 14
our 3
kind 31
friend 14
the 193
for 484
direction 5
They 5
were 5
in 2719
street 15
He 962
saw 24
and 51
on 86
Lydia 4
His 43
first 8
object 26
with 34
her 181
he 962
had 11
to 805
persuade 6
her 181
to 805
quit 14
her 181
present 20
disgraceful 4
situation 3
and 51
return 14
to 805
her 181
friends 4
as 509
soon 3
as 509
they 5
be 1200
on 86
to 805
receive 8
her 181
offering 3
his 43
as 509
far 91
as 509
it 67
would 5
go 500
But 82
he 962
found 18
Lydia 4
on 86
where 21
she 199
was 93
She 199
for 484
none 32
of 109
her 181
friends 4
she 199
no 896
help 23
of 109
his 43
she 199
would 5
not 85
hear 76
of 109
leaving 3
She 199
was 93
sure 11
they 5
should 7
be 1200
married 3
some 30
time 45
or 333
other 5
and 51
it 67
did 23
not 85
when 6
Since 7
were 5
her 181
it 67
he 962
thought 11
to 805
secure 6
and 51
expedite 6
a 6799
marriage 6
in 2719
his 43
first 8
conversation 8
with 34
he 962
had 11
never 3
his 43
design 16
He 962
to 805
leave 14
the 193
regiment 8
on 86
account 14
of 109
some 30
of 109
were 5
pressing 4
and 51
not 85
to 805
lay 42
all 162
the 193
ill 84
of 109
flight 9
on 86
her 181
own 9
He 962
meant 3
to 805
resign 8
his 43
commission 10
and 51
as 509
to 805
his 43
future 3
situation 3
he 962
conjecture 4
little 6
it 67
He 962
must 28
go 500
but 82
he 962
did 23
not 85
know 12
where 21
and 51
he 962
he 962
should 7
have 11
nothing 5
to 805
live 43
on 86
Mr 5
him 9
why 4
he 962
had 11
not 85
married 3
your 4
sister 9
at 272
Though 12
Mr 5
was 93
not 85
to 805
be 1200
rich 19
he 962
would 5
have 11
able 3
to 805
do 814
something 3
for 484
him 9
and 51
his 43
situation 3
must 28
have 11
by 57
marriage 6
But 82
he 962
found 18
in 2719
reply 3
to 805
this 6
question 16
that 11
still 13
the 193
hope 16
of 109
more 11
making 4
his 43
fortune 8
by 57
marriage 6
in 2719
some 30
other 5
country 12
Under 288
he 962
was 93
not 85
to 805
be 1200
proof 11
the 193
temptation 3
of 109
immediate 4
relief 3
They 5
met 180
several 3
times 10
for 484
there 21
was 93
to 805
be 1200
of 109
course 10
more 11
than 22
he 962
get 13
but 82
at 272
length 14
was 93
to 805
be 1200
reasonable 3
being 3
them 9
Mr 5
step 48
was 93
to 805
make 17
your 4
uncle 18
with 34
it 67
and 51
he 962
first 8
in 2719
street 15
the 193
evening 3
I 4330
came 36
home 90
But 82
Mr 5
not 85
be 1200
and 51
Mr 5
found 18
on 86
further 8
that 11
your 4
father 12
was 93
still 13
with 34
him 9
but 82
would 5
quit 14
town 27
the 193
morning 3
He 962
did 23
not 85
judge 6
your 4
father 12
to 805
be 1200
a 6799
person 33
whom 3
he 962
so 797
consult 14
as 509
your 4
uncle 18
and 51
him 9
till 14
after 48
the 193
departure 3
of 109
the 193
former 3
He 962
did 23
not 85
leave 14
his 43
name 17
and 51
till 14
the 193
day 27
it 67
was 93
that 11
a 6799
gentleman 3
had 11
on 86
business 13
On 86
Saturday 3
he 962
came 36
Your 4
father 12
was 93
gone 4
your 4
uncle 18
at 272
home 90
and 51
as 509
I 4330
they 5
had 11
a 6799
great 12
deal 13
of 109
talk 18
together 3
They 5
met 180
on 86
Sunday 3
and 51
then 5
I 4330
saw 24
him 9
too 50
It 67
was 93
not 85
all 162
Monday 3
as 509
soon 3
as 509
it 67
was 93
the 193
express 25
was 93
sent 35
off 100
to 805
But 82
our 3
visitor 3
was 93
I 4330
fancy 5
that 11
is 124
the 193
real 47
defect 17
of 109
his 43
character 16
after 48
all 162
He 962
has 41
of 109
at 272
different 11
times 10
but 82
this 6
is 124
the 193
true 9
one 19
Nothing 5
was 93
to 805
be 1200
done 3
that 11
he 962
did 23
not 85
do 814
though 12
I 4330
am 392
sure 11
and 51
I 4330
do 814
not 85
speak 12
it 67
to 805
be 1200
say 7
nothing 5
it 67
your 4
uncle 18
would 5
most 3
have 11
the 193
whole 26
They 5
battled 5
it 67
together 3
for 484
a 6799
long 49
time 45
was 93
more 11
than 22
the 193
gentleman 3
or 333
lady 18
in 2719
it 67
But 82
at 272
last 7
your 4
uncle 18
was 93
to 805
yield 6
and 51
of 109
being 3
to 805
be 1200
of 109
use 18
to 805
his 43
niece 3
was 93
to 805
put 47
up 194
with 34
the 193
probable 3
credit 12
of 109
it 67
the 193
grain 9
and 51
I 4330
believe 6
your 4
letter 20
this 6
morning 3
gave 4
him 9
great 12
pleasure 5
it 67
an 970
explanation 3
that 11
would 5
rob 65
him 9
of 109
his 43
and 51
give 15
the 193
praise 7
where 21
it 67
was 93
due 21
But 82
this 6
must 28
go 500
no 896
than 22
or 333
Jane 8
at 272
most 3
You 29
know 12
pretty 3
well 24
I 4330
suppose 4
what 14
has 41
done 3
for 484
the 193
young 9
people 4
His 43
are 12
to 805
be 1200
I 4330
believe 6
to 805
more 11
than 22
a 6799
thousand 7
thousand 7
in 2719
addition 5
to 805
her 181
own 9
her 181
and 51
his 43
commission 10
The 193
reason 13
why 4
all 162
this 6
was 93
to 805
be 1200
done 3
by 57
him 9
was 93
as 509
I 4330
have 11
given 3
above 3
It 67
was 93
to 805
him 9
to 805
his 43
reserve 7
and 51
want 13
of 109
proper 9
consideration 3
that 11
character 16
had 11
so 797
and 51
that 11
he 962
had 11
and 51
as 509
he 962
was 93
there 21
was 93
some 30
truth 7
in 2719
this 6
though 12
I 4330
doubt 15
his 43
reserve 7
or 333
reserve 7
can 287
be 1200
for 484
the 193
event 18
But 82
in 2719
spite 10
of 109
all 162
this 6
fine 17
my 90
dear 15
you 29
may 49
rest 110
assured 4
that 11
your 4
uncle 18
would 5
never 3
have 11
if 8
we 444
had 11
not 85
given 3
him 9
credit 12
for 484
interest 6
in 2719
the 193
affair 3
When 6
all 162
this 6
was 93
on 86
he 962
to 805
his 43
friends 4
who 79
were 5
still 13
at 272
but 82
it 67
was 93
that 11
he 962
should 7
be 1200
in 2719
London 5
more 11
when 6
the 193
wedding 3
place 29
and 51
all 162
money 17
were 5
then 5
to 805
receive 8
the 193
last 7
finish 8
I 4330
believe 6
I 4330
have 11
now 10
you 29
every 10
thing 15
It 67
is 124
a 6799
relation 7
you 29
tell 16
me 1041
is 124
to 805
give 15
you 29
great 12
surprise 4
I 4330
hope 16
at 272
least 3
it 67
will 39
not 85
afford 6
you 29
any 17
Lydia 4
came 36
to 805
us 70
and 51
had 11
constant 7
admission 3
to 805
the 193
house 87
He 962
was 93
what 14
he 962
had 11
when 6
I 4330
him 9
in 2719
but 82
I 4330
would 5
not 85
tell 16
you 29
how 27
little 6
I 4330
was 93
with 34
her 181
while 4
she 199
staid 6
with 34
us 70
if 8
I 4330
had 11
not 85
by 57
letter 20
last 7
Wednesday 3
that 11
her 181
conduct 21
on 86
coming 3
home 90
was 93
of 109
a 6799
piece 10
with 34
it 67
and 51
what 14
I 4330
now 10
tell 16
you 29
can 287
give 15
you 29
no 896
fresh 22
pain 42
I 4330
to 805
her 181
in 2719
the 193
most 3
serious 4
manner 8
to 805
her 181
all 162
the 193
of 109
what 14
she 199
had 11
done 3
and 51
all 162
the 193
she 199
had 11
on 86
her 181
If 8
she 199
me 1041
it 67
was 93
by 57
good 28
luck 14
for 484
I 4330
am 392
sure 11
she 199
did 23
not 85
listen 9
I 4330
was 93
but 82
then 5
I 4330
my 90
dear 15
Elizabeth 5
and 51
Jane 8
and 51
for 484
had 11
with 34
her 181
Mr 5
was 93
punctual 4
in 2719
his 43
return 14
and 51
as 509
Lydia 4
you 29
the 193
wedding 3
He 962

us 70
the 193
day 27
and 51
was 93
to 805
leave 14
town 27
on 86
Wednesday 3
or 333
Thursday 3
Will 39
you 29
be 1200
with 34
me 1041
my 90
dear 15
if 8
I 4330
take 18
this 6
of 109
saying 3
what 14
I 4330
was 93
never 3
bold 9
to 805
say 7
how 27
I 4330
like 22
him 9
His 43
to 805
us 70
has 41
in 2719
every 10
respect 18
as 509
pleasing 3
as 509
when 6
we 444
were 5
in 2719
His 43
understanding 4
and 51
all 162
please 3
me 1041
he 962
nothing 5
but 82
a 6799
little 6
more 11
and 51
that 11
if 8
he 962
his 43
wife 6
may 49
teach 9
him 9
I 4330
thought 11
him 9
sly 4
he 962
ever 33
your 4
name 17
But 82
the 193
fashion 10
Pray 9
forgive 8
me 1041
if 8
I 4330
have 11
or 333
at 272
least 3
do 814
not 85
punish 9
me 1041
so 797
far 91
as 509
to 805
exclude 3
me 1041
P 8948
I 4330
shall 12
never 3
be 1200
till 14
I 4330
have 11
all 162
round 29
the 193
park 18
A 6799
low 46
phaeton 3
with 34
a 6799
nice 11
little 6
pair 7
of 109
would 5
be 1200
the 193
thing 15
But 82
I 4330
must 28
write 5
no 896
more 11
The 193

this 6
half 23
hour 10
Yours 3
M 6769
The 193
of 109
this 6
letter 20
Elizabeth 5
into 26
a 6799
flutter 6
of 109
in 2719
it 67
was 93
difficult 5
to 805
determine 7
pleasure 5
or 333
pain 42
bore 13
the 193
share 22
The 193
vague 6
and 51
had 11
of 109
what 14
Mr 5
might 9
have 11
doing 3
to 805
forward 12
her 181
match 25
she 199
had 11
to 805
encourage 6
as 509
an 970
exertion 3
of 109
too 50
great 12
to 805
be 1200
probable 3
and 51
at 272
the 193
same 5
time 45
to 805
be 1200
just 24
the 193
pain 42
of 109
obligation 3
were 5
extent 3
to 805
be 1200
true 9
He 962
had 11
them 9
to 805
town 27
he 962
had 11
on 86
all 162
the 193
trouble 18
and 51
attendant 3
on 86
a 6799
research 8
in 2719
supplication 3
had 11
to 805
a 6799
woman 21
whom 3
he 962
must 28
abominate 3
and 51
despise 3
and 51
where 21
he 962
was 93
to 805
meet 9
meet 9
reason 13
with 34
persuade 6
and 51
bribe 9
the 193
man 342
whom 3
he 962
most 3
to 805
avoid 8
and 51
name 17
it 67
was 93
punishment 3
to 805
him 9
to 805
pronounce 7
He 962
had 11
done 3
all 162
this 6
for 484
a 6799
girl 14
whom 3
he 962
regard 7
nor 102
esteem 5
Her 181
heart 57
did 23
whisper 8
that 11
he 962
had 11
done 3
it 67
for 484
her 181
But 82
it 67
was 93
a 6799
hope 16
by 57
other 5
and 51
she 199
soon 3
felt 5
that 11
even 36
her 181
was 93
when 6
to 805
depend 17
on 86
his 43
affection 5
for 484
her 181
for 484
a 6799
woman 21
who 79
had 11
him 9
as 509
able 3
to 805
a 6799
sentiment 18
so 797
natural 18
as 509
relationship 3
with 34
Brother 9
in 2719
law 45
of 109
Every 10
kind 31
of 109
pride 6
must 28
revolt 6
the 193
connection 3
He 962
had 11
to 805
be 1200
sure 11
done 3
She 199
was 93
to 805
think 8
how 27
But 82
he 962
had 11
given 3
a 6799
reason 13
for 484
his 43
no 896
stretch 15
of 109
belief 3
It 67
was 93
reasonable 3
that 11
he 962
should 7
feel 11
he 962
had 11
wrong 24
he 962
had 11
and 51
he 962
had 11
the 193
of 109
it 67
and 51
though 12
she 199
would 5
not 85
place 29
as 509
his 43
principal 7
inducement 3
she 199
believe 6
that 11
for 484
her 181
might 9
assist 10
his 43
in 2719
a 6799
cause 14
where 21
her 181
peace 21
of 109
mind 25
must 28
be 1200
It 67
was 93
painful 6
painful 6
to 805
know 12
that 11
they 5
were 5
under 288
to 805
a 6799
person 33
who 79
never 3
receive 8
a 6799
return 14
They 5
the 193
restoration 3
of 109
Lydia 4
her 181
character 16
every 10
thing 15
to 805
him 9
Oh 17
how 27
did 23
she 199
grieve 6
over 596
every 10
sensation 14
she 199
had 11
ever 33
every 10
speech 13
she 199
had 11
ever 33
him 9
For 484
she 199
was 93
but 82
she 199
was 93
proud 5
of 109
him 9
Proud 5
that 11
in 2719
a 6799
cause 14
of 109
compassion 4
and 51
he 962
had 11
able 3
to 805
get 13
the 193
better 7
of 109
She 199
read 49
over 596
her 181
commendation 3
of 109
him 9
and 51
It 67
was 93
but 82
it 67
her 181
She 199
was 93
even 36
sensible 3
of 109
some 30
pleasure 5
though 12
with 34
regret 9
on 86
finding 4
how 27
both 8
she 199
and 51
her 181
uncle 18
had 11
that 11
affection 5
and 51
confidence 3
Mr 5
and 51
She 199
was 93
her 181
seat 12
and 51
her 181
by 57
some 30
approach 6
and 51
she 199
strike 14
into 26
path 25
she 199
was 93
by 57
I 4330
am 392
I 4330
interrupt 11
your 4
ramble 7
my 90
dear 15
sister 9
he 962
as 509
he 962
her 181
You 29
do 814
she 199
with 34
a 6799
smile 7
but 82
it 67
does 5
not 85
follow 11
that 11
the 193
interruption 3
must 28
be 1200
I 4330
should 7
be 1200
if 8
it 67
were 5
We 444
were 5
good 28
friends 4
and 51
now 10
we 444
are 12
better 7
True 9
Are 12
the 193
coming 3
out 365
I 4330
do 814
not 85
know 12
and 51
Lydia 4
are 12
going 3
in 2719
the 193
carriage 5
to 805
And 51
so 797
my 90
dear 15
sister 9
I 4330
find 10
our 3
uncle 18
and 51
aunt 6
that 11
you 29
have 11
She 199
in 2719
the 193
affirmative 4
I 4330
envy 4
you 29
the 193
pleasure 5
and 51
yet 4
I 4330
believe 6
it 67
would 5
be 1200
too 50
for 484
me 1041
or 333
I 4330
take 18
it 67
in 2719
my 90
way 27
to 805
And 51
you 29
saw 24
the 193
old 21
housekeeper 3
I 4330
suppose 4
Poor 11
she 199
was 93
fond 17
of 109
me 1041
But 82
of 109
course 10
she 199
did 23
not 85
mention 5
my 90
name 17
to 805
you 29
Yes 16
she 199
did 23
And 51
what 14
did 23
she 199
say 7
That 11
you 29
were 5
gone 4
into 26
the 193
and 51
she 199
was 93
had 11
not 85
out 365
well 24
At 272
a 6799
distance 4
as 509
that 11
you 29
know 12
are 12
he 962
his 43
lips 8
Elizabeth 5
she 199
had 11
him 9
but 82
he 962
soon 3
I 4330
was 93
to 805
see 70
in 2719
town 27
last 7
month 6
We 444
other 5
several 3
times 10
I 4330
wonder 17
what 14
he 962
can 287
be 1200
doing 3
there 21
for 484
his 43
marriage 6
with 34
Miss 71
de 2452
Elizabeth 5
It 67
must 28
be 1200
something 3
particular 13
to 805
take 18
him 9
there 21
at 272
this 6
time 45

Did 23

Yes 16

And 51

that 11

When 6
I 4330

am 392
glad 30
you 29
her 181
I 4330
hope 16
she 199
will 39
turn 46
out 365
well 24
I 4330
dare 15
say 7
she 199
will 39
she 199
has 41
got 14
over 596
the 193
most 3
age 24
Did 23
you 29
go 500
by 57
the 193
village 6
of 109
I 4330
do 814
not 85
recollect 7
that 11
we 444
did 23
I 4330
mention 5
it 67
it 67
is 124
the 193
living 5
I 4330
to 805
have 11
had 11
A 6799
most 3
place 29
Parsonage 3
House 87
It 67
would 5
have 11
me 1041
in 2719
every 10
respect 18
How 27
should 7
you 29
have 11
making 4
well 24
I 4330
should 7
have 11
it 67
as 509
part 102
of 109
my 90
and 51
the 193
exertion 3
would 5
soon 3
have 11
nothing 5
One 19
not 85
to 805
repine 3
but 82
to 805
be 1200
sure 11
it 67
would 5
have 11
a 6799
thing 15
for 484
me 1041
The 193
quiet 20
the 193
retirement 3
of 109
a 6799
life 44
would 5
have 11
all 162
my 90
of 109
But 82
it 67
was 93
not 85

Did 23
you 29

circumstance 4
when 6
you 29
were 5

Kent 9

have 11
I 4330
thought 11
as 509
good 28
that 11
it 67
was 93
left 19
you 29

patron 21
You 29

Yes 16

was 93
something 3
in 2719

I 4330
you 29
so 797
the 193
first 8
you 29

a 6799
time 45
when 6
sermon 7

not 85
so 797
to 805
you 29
as 509
it 67
to 805
be 1200
at 272
present 20
that 11
you 29
your 4
resolution 3
of 109
never 3
taking 4
and 51
that 11
the 193
business 13
had 11
You 29
did 23
and 51
it 67
was 93
not 85
foundation 3
You 29
may 49
remember 4
what 14
I 4330
you 29
on 86
that 11
point 22
when 6
first 8

They 5
were 5
now 10
at 272
the 193
door 41
of 109
the 193
house 87
for 484
she 199
had 11
fast 29
to 805
get 13
rid 42
of 109
him 9
and 51
unwilling 4
for 484
her 181
to 805
provoke 6
him 9
she 199
in 2719
reply 3
with 34
a 6799
good 28
smile 7
Come 36

Do 814
not 85
let 50
us 70
quarrel 11

past 71
In 2719
future 3
I 4330
hope 16
we 444
shall 12
be 1200
of 109
one 19
mind 25
She 199

the 193
house 87
Chapter 3
Mr 5
was 93
so 797
with 34
this 6
conversation 8
that 11
he 962
never 3
or 333
his 43
dear 15
sister 9
Elizabeth 5
by 57
the 193
subject 11
of 109
it 67
and 51
she 199
was 93
to 805
find 10
that 11
she 199
had 11
to 805
keep 11
him 9
quiet 20
The 193
day 27
of 109
his 43
and 51
departure 3
soon 3
came 36
and 51
was 93
to 805
submit 5
to 805
a 6799
separation 3
as 509
her 181
husband 10
by 57
no 896
into 26
her 181
scheme 7
of 109
all 162
going 3
to 805
was 93
to 805
continue 3
at 272
least 3
a 6799
twelvemonth 3
Oh 17
my 90
dear 15
Lydia 4
she 199
when 6
shall 12
we 444
meet 9
Oh 17
lord 13
I 4330
know 12
Not 85
these 4
two 14
or 333
three 12
Write 5
to 805
me 1041
often 4
my 90
dear 15
As 509
often 4
as 509
I 4330
can 287
But 82
you 29
know 12
married 3
women 5
have 11
never 3
time 45
for 484
writing 3
My 90
may 49
write 5
to 805
me 1041
They 5
will 39
have 11
nothing 5
to 805
do 814
Mr 5
were 5
more 11
than 22
his 43
He 962
handsome 6
and 51
pretty 3
He 962
is 124
as 509
fine 17
a 6799
fellow 9
Mr 5
as 509
soon 3
as 509
they 5
were 5
out 365
of 109
the 193
house 87
as 509
ever 33
I 4330
saw 24
He 962
and 51
and 51
makes 4
love 29
to 805
us 70
all 162
I 4330
am 392
proud 5
of 109
him 9
I 4330
even 36
Sir 22
William 3
to 805
produce 7
a 6799
more 11
valuable 3
son 70
in 2719
law 45
The 193
loss 3
of 109
her 181
daughter 4
made 13
dull 13
for 484
several 3
I 4330
often 4
think 8
she 199
that 11
there 21
is 124
nothing 5
so 797
bad 33
as 509
parting 3
with 34
friends 4
One 19
so 797
them 9
This 6
is 124
the 193
consequence 3
you 29
see 70
Madam 5
of 109
a 6799
daughter 4
Elizabeth 5
It 67
must 28
make 17
you 29
better 7
that 11
your 4
other 5
four 26
are 12
single 15
It 67
is 124
no 896
thing 15
Lydia 4
does 5
not 85
leave 14
me 1041
she 199
is 124
married 3
but 82
her 181
regiment 8
happens 4
to 805
be 1200
so 797
far 91
off 100
If 8
that 11
had 11
she 199
would 5
not 85
have 11
gone 4
so 797
soon 3
But 82
the 193
condition 13
this 6
event 18
her 181
into 26
was 93
and 51
her 181
mind 25
to 805
the 193
agitation 3
of 109
hope 16
by 57
an 970
article 4
of 109
news 71
then 5
to 805
be 1200
in 2719
circulation 3
The 193
housekeeper 3
at 272
had 11
to 805
prepare 5
for 484
the 193
arrival 3
of 109
her 181
master 28
who 79
was 93
coming 3
down 90
in 2719
a 6799
day 27
or 333
two 14
to 805
shoot 12
there 21
for 484
several 3
was 93
in 2719
the 193
She 199
at 272
Jane 8
and 51
and 51
her 181
head 140
by 57
turns 4
Well 24
well 24
and 51
so 797
Mr 5
is 124
coming 3
down 90
sister 9
for 484
first 8
her 181
the 193
news 71
Well 24
so 797
the 193
better 7
Not 85
that 11
I 4330
care 47
it 67
though 12
He 962
is 124
nothing 5
to 805
us 70
you 29
know 12
and 51
I 4330
am 392
sure 11
I 4330
never 3
want 13
to 805
see 70
him 9
But 82
he 962
is 124
welcome 4
to 805
come 36
to 805
if 8
he 962
it 67
And 51
who 79
what 14
may 49
happen 9
But 82
that 11
is 124
nothing 5
to 805
us 70
You 29
know 12
sister 9
we 444
long 49
ago 15
never 3
to 805
mention 5
a 6799
word 26
it 67
And 51
so 797
is 124
it 67
certain 5
he 962
is 124
coming 3
You 29
may 49
depend 17
on 86
it 67
the 193
other 5
for 484
was 93
in 2719
last 7
night 61
I 4330
saw 24
her 181
passing 3
by 57
and 51
out 365
on 86
purpose 12
to 805
know 12
the 193
truth 7
of 109
it 67
and 51
she 199
me 1041
that 11
it 67
was 93
certain 5
true 9
He 962
comes 4
down 90
on 86
Thursday 3
at 272
the 193
on 86
Wednesday 3
She 199
was 93
going 3
to 805
the 193
she 199
me 1041
on 86
purpose 12
to 805
order 11
in 2719
some 30
meat 17
on 86
Wednesday 3
and 51
she 199
has 41
got 14
three 12
couple 7
of 109
just 24
fit 28
to 805
be 1200
Miss 71
had 11
not 85
able 3
to 805
hear 76
of 109
his 43
coming 3
It 67
was 93
since 7
she 199
had 11
his 43
name 17
to 805
Elizabeth 5
but 82
now 10
as 509
soon 3
as 509
they 5
were 5
together 3
she 199
I 4330
saw 24
you 29
look 14
at 272
me 1041
to 805
day 27
when 6
my 90
aunt 6
us 70
of 109
the 193
present 20
report 12
and 51
I 4330
know 12
I 4330
But 82
imagine 3
it 67
was 93
any 17
cause 14
I 4330
was 93
for 484
the 193
moment 14
I 4330
felt 5
that 11
I 4330
should 7
be 1200
at 272
I 4330
do 814
assure 6
you 29
that 11
the 193
news 71
does 5
not 85
affect 15
me 1041
with 34
pleasure 5
or 333
pain 42
I 4330
am 392
glad 30
of 109
one 19
thing 15
that 11
he 962
comes 4
we 444
shall 12
see 70
the 193
less 19
of 109
him 9
Not 85
that 11
I 4330
am 392
of 109
but 82
I 4330
dread 14
other 5
Elizabeth 5
did 23
not 85
know 12
what 14
to 805
make 17
of 109
it 67
Had 11
she 199
not 85
him 9
in 2719
she 199
might 9
have 11
him 9
of 109
coming 3
there 21
with 34
no 896
other 5
view 18
than 22
what 14
was 93
but 82
she 199
still 13
thought 11
him 9
partial 6
to 805
Jane 8
and 51
she 199
as 509
to 805
the 193
of 109
his 43
coming 3
there 21
with 34
his 43
permission 3
or 333
being 3
bold 9
to 805
come 36
it 67
Yet 4
it 67
is 124
hard 70
she 199
thought 11
that 11
this 6
poor 11
man 342
come 36
to 805
a 6799
house 87
he 962
has 41
all 162
this 6
speculation 3
I 4330
will 39
leave 14
him 9
to 805
In 2719
spite 10
of 109
what 14
her 181
sister 9
and 51
to 805
be 1200
her 181
in 2719
the 193
expectation 3
of 109
his 43
arrival 3
Elizabeth 5
perceive 3
that 11
her 181
were 5
by 57
it 67
They 5
were 5
more 11
more 11
unequal 3
than 22
she 199
had 11
often 4
them 9
The 193
subject 11
had 11
so 797
a 6799
twelvemonth 3
ago 15
was 93
now 10
forward 12
As 509
soon 3
as 509
ever 33
Mr 5
comes 4
my 90
dear 15
you 29
will 39
wait 19
on 86
him 9
of 109
course 10
No 896
no 896
You 29
me 1041
into 26
him 9
last 7
year 19
and 51
if 8
I 4330
to 805
see 70
him 9
he 962
should 7
one 19
of 109
my 90
But 82
it 67
in 2719
nothing 5
and 51
I 4330
will 39
not 85
be 1200
sent 35
on 86
a 6799
errand 3
His 43
wife 6
to 805
him 9
how 27
an 970
attention 3
would 5
be 1200
all 162
the 193
on 86
his 43
to 805
an 970
I 4330
despise 3
he 962
If 8
he 962
our 3
let 50
him 9
seek 6
it 67
He 962
where 21
we 444
live 43
I 4330
will 39
not 85
spend 11
my 90
in 2719
after 48
my 90

Mr 5

There 21

Some 30

La 977

be 1200
sure 11
but 82
I 4330
must 28
say 7
that 11
I 4330
hate 14
the 193
sight 17
of 109
him 9
Jane 8
at 272
Elizabeth 5
with 34
surprise 4
and 51
concern 6
She 199
but 82
little 6
of 109

in 2719
and 51
felt 5
for 484

attend 15
her 181
sister 9
in 2719
him 9
for 484
the 193
first 8
time 45
after 48
his 43
letter 20
Both 8
were 5
felt 5
for 484
the 193
other 5
and 51
of 109
course 10
for 484
and 51
mother 21
on 86
of 109
her 181
dislike 4
of 109
Mr 5
and 51
her 181
resolution 3
to 805
be 1200
civil 15
to 805
him 9
as 509
Mr 5
friend 14
being 3
by 57
of 109
them 9
But 82
Elizabeth 5
had 11
of 109
not 85
be 1200
by 57
Jane 8
to 805
whom 3
she 199
had 11
never 3
yet 4
had 11
courage 6
to 805
shew 5
letter 20
or 333
to 805
relate 8
her 181
own 9
change 21
of 109
sentiment 18
him 9
To 805
Jane 8
he 962
be 1200
a 6799
man 342
she 199
had 11
and 51
merit 13
she 199
had 11
but 82
to 805
her 181
own 9
more 11
extensive 4
information 3
he 962
was 93
the 193
person 33
to 805
whom 3
the 193
whole 26
were 5
indebted 3
for 484
the 193
first 8
of 109
and 51
whom 3
she 199
with 34
an 970
interest 6
if 8
not 85
so 797
tender 27
at 272
least 3
as 509
reasonable 3
and 51
just 24
as 509
what 14
Jane 8
felt 5
for 484
Her 181
at 272
his 43
coming 3
at 272
his 43
coming 3
to 805
to 805
and 51
her 181
was 93
equal 17
to 805
what 14
she 199
had 11
on 86
first 8
his 43
in 2719
The 193
had 11
her 181
face 19
for 484
half 23
a 6799
minute 12
with 34
an 970
glow 14
and 51
a 6799
smile 7
of 109
delight 8
to 805
her 181
eyes 8
as 509
she 199
thought 11
for 484
that 11
space 34
of 109
time 45
that 11
his 43
affection 5
and 51
must 28
still 13
be 1200
But 82
she 199
would 5
not 85
be 1200
secure 6
Let 50
me 1041
first 8
see 70
how 27
he 962
she 199
it 67
will 39
then 5
be 1200
for 484
expectation 3
She 199
sat 92
at 272
work 87
to 805
be 1200
and 51
daring 3
to 805
lift 11
up 194
her 181
eyes 8
till 14
anxious 4
them 9
to 805
the 193
face 19
of 109
her 181
sister 9
as 509
the 193
servant 3
was 93
the 193
door 41
Jane 8
a 6799
little 6
paler 3
than 22
usual 3
but 82
more 11
sedate 8
than 22
Elizabeth 5
had 11
On 86
the 193
her 181
yet 4
she 199
them 9
with 34
ease 10
and 51
with 34
a 6799
of 109
free 93
any 17
symptom 5
of 109
resentment 3
or 333
any 17
Elizabeth 5
as 509
little 6
to 805
as 509
would 5
allow 9
and 51
sat 92
down 90
to 805
her 181
work 87
with 34
an 970
it 67
did 23
not 85
often 4
command 21
She 199
had 11
one 19
glance 4
at 272
He 962
serious 4
as 509
usual 3
and 51
she 199
thought 11
more 11
as 509
he 962
had 11
to 805
look 14
in 2719
than 22
as 509
she 199
had 11
him 9
at 272
But 82
he 962
not 85
in 2719
her 181
presence 3
be 1200
what 14
he 962
was 93
her 181
uncle 18
and 51
aunt 6
It 67
was 93
a 6799
painful 6
but 82
not 85
an 970
conjecture 4
she 199
had 11
for 484
an 970
instant 11
and 51
in 2719
that 11
short 62
period 16
saw 24
him 9
both 8
and 51
He 962
was 93
by 57
with 34
a 6799
degree 3
of 109
made 13
her 181
two 14
when 6
with 34
the 193
cold 9
and 51
ceremonious 4
of 109
her 181
and 51
address 9
to 805
his 43
friend 14
Elizabeth 5
who 79
that 11
her 181
mother 21
to 805
the 193
latter 3
the 193
preservation 5
of 109
her 181
daughter 4
was 93
hurt 12
and 51
to 805
a 6799
most 3
painful 6
degree 3
by 57
a 6799
distinction 3
so 797
ill 84
after 48
of 109
her 181
how 27
Mr 5
and 51
did 23
a 6799
question 16
she 199
not 85
answer 8
confusion 3
anything 3
He 962
was 93
not 85
by 57
her 181
that 11
was 93
the 193
reason 13
of 109
his 43
silence 7
but 82
it 67
had 11
not 85
so 797
in 2719
There 21
he 962
had 11
to 805
her 181
friends 4
when 6
he 962
not 85
to 805
But 82
now 10
several 3
the 193
sound 29
of 109
his 43
voice 8
and 51
when 6
to 805
resist 17
the 193
impulse 4
of 109
she 199
her 181
eyes 8
to 805
his 43
face 19
she 199
as 509
often 4
found 18
him 9
at 272
Jane 8
as 509
at 272
and 51
on 86
no 896
object 26
but 82
the 193
ground 36
More 11
and 51
less 19
to 805
please 3
than 22
when 6
they 5
last 7
met 180
were 5
She 199
was 93
and 51
with 34
for 484
being 3
so 797
I 4330
expect 20
it 67
to 805
be 1200
she 199
Yet 4
why 4
did 23
he 962
come 36
She 199
was 93
in 2719
no 896
for 484
conversation 8
with 34
but 82
and 51
to 805
him 9
she 199
had 11
courage 6
to 805
speak 12
She 199
after 48
his 43
sister 9
but 82
do 814
no 896
more 11
It 67
is 124
a 6799
long 49
time 45
Mr 5
since 7
you 29
He 962
to 805
it 67
I 4330
to 805
be 1200
you 29
would 5
never 3
come 36
back 182
People 4
did 23
say 7
you 29
meant 3
to 805
quit 14
the 193
place 29
at 272
Michaelmas 3
but 82
I 4330
hope 16
it 67
is 124
not 85
true 9
A 6799
great 12
have 11
in 2719
the 193
since 7
you 29
Miss 71
is 124
married 3
and 51
And 51
one 19
of 109
my 90
own 9
I 4330
suppose 4
you 29
have 11
of 109
it 67
you 29
must 28
have 11
it 67
in 2719
the 193
It 67
was 93
in 2719
The 193
Times 10
and 51
The 193
Courier 5
I 4330
know 12
though 12
it 67
was 93
not 85
put 47
in 2719
as 509
it 67
to 805
be 1200
It 67
was 93
George 6
Esq 5
to 805
Miss 71
Lydia 4
there 21
being 3
a 6799
syllable 3
of 109
her 181
father 12
or 333
the 193
place 29
where 21
she 199
or 333
anything 3
It 67
was 93
my 90
brother 9
drawing 3
up 194
too 50
and 51
I 4330
wonder 17
how 27
he 962
came 36
to 805
make 17
an 970
awkward 6
business 13
of 109
it 67
Did 23
you 29
see 70
it 67
that 11
he 962
did 23
and 51
made 13
his 43
Elizabeth 5
dared 6
not 85
lift 11
up 194
her 181
eyes 8
How 27
Mr 5
she 199
not 85
tell 16
It 67
is 124
a 6799
thing 15
to 805
be 1200
sure 11
to 805
have 11
a 6799
daughter 4
well 24
married 3
her 181
mother 21
but 82
at 272
the 193
same 5
time 45
Mr 5
it 67
is 124
hard 70
to 805
have 11
her 181
a 6799
way 27
me 1041
They 5
are 12
gone 4
down 90
to 805
a 6799
place 29
it 67
and 51
there 21
they 5
are 12
to 805
stay 7
I 4330
do 814
not 85
know 12
how 27
long 49
His 43
regiment 8
is 124
there 21
for 484
I 4330
suppose 4
you 29
have 11
of 109
his 43
leaving 3
the 193
shire 3
and 51
of 109
his 43
being 3
gone 4
into 26
the 193
Thank 15
Heaven 9
he 962
has 41
some 30
friends 4
though 12
not 85
so 797
as 509
he 962
Elizabeth 5
who 79
this 6
to 805
be 1200
at 272
Mr 5
was 93
in 2719
of 109
shame 14
that 11
she 199
keep 11

Were 5
the 193
same 5
fair 25
prospect 13
to 805
arise 3
at 272
present 20
as 509
had 11
them 9
a 6799
year 19
ago 15
every 10
thing 15
she 199
was 93
would 5
be 1200
to 805
the 193
same 5
conclusion 3
At 272
that 11
instant 11
she 199
felt 5
that 11
of 109
not 85
make 17
Jane 8
or 333
for 484
of 109
painful 6
confusion 3
The 193
first 8
wish 13
of 109
my 90
heart 57
she 199
to 805
is 124
never 3
more 11
to 805
be 1200
in 2719
with 34
of 109
them 9
can 287
afford 6
no 896
pleasure 5
that 11
will 39
atone 5
for 484
as 509
this 6
Let 50
me 1041
never 3
see 70
one 19
or 333
the 193
other 5
Yet 4
the 193
for 484
of 109
were 5
to 805
offer 10
no 896
compensation 3
soon 3
material 17
relief 3
how 27
the 193
of 109
her 181
sister 9
re 3833
the 193
of 109
her 181
former 3
lover 3
When 6
first 8
he 962
came 36
in 2719
he 962
had 11
to 805
her 181
but 82
little 6
but 82
every 10
five 5
to 805
be 1200
her 181
more 11
of 109
his 43
attention 3
He 962
found 18
her 181
as 509
handsome 6
as 509
she 199
had 11
last 7
year 19
as 509
good 28
and 51
as 509
though 12
not 85
so 797
Jane 8
was 93
anxious 4
that 11
no 896
difference 3
should 7
be 1200
in 2719
her 181
at 272
all 162
and 51
was 93
that 11
she 199
as 509
as 509
ever 33
But 82
her 181
mind 25
was 93
so 797
that 11
she 199
did 23
not 85
know 12
when 6
she 199
was 93
silent 6
When 6
the 193

mindful 4
of 109
her 181

your 4
engagement 3
a 6799
little 6
at 272
this 6
reflection 3
and 51
something 3
of 109
his 43
concern 6
at 272
by 57

They 5
then 5

and 51
dine 9

that 11

but 82
though 12
she 199

she 199
did 23
not 85
think 8
anything 3
less 19
than 22

be 1200
good 28
for 484
a 6799
man 342
on 86
whom 3
she 199
had 11
anxious 4
or 333
satisfy 3
the 193
appetite 3
and 51
pride 6
of 109
one 19

As 509

gone 4
Elizabeth 5
out 365
to 805

her 181
or 333
in 2719
other 5
words 5
to 805
dwell 8

on 86
that 11
must 28
deaden 4
them 9
more 11
Mr 5
and 51
her 181
Why 4
if 8
he 962
came 36
to 805
be 1200
silent 6
grave 28
and 51
she 199
did 23
he 962
come 36
at 272
all 162
She 199
settle 10
it 67
in 2719
no 896
way 27
that 11

her 181

my 90

and 51
aunt 6
when 6
he 962
was 93

town 27
and 51
why 4
not 85

If 8
he 962

If 8

why 4
silent 6
man 342
I 4330
will 39
think 8
no 896
more 11
him 9
Her 181
resolution 3
was 93
for 484
a 6799
short 62
time 45
by 57
the 193
approach 6
of 109
her 181
sister 9
who 79
her 181
with 34
a 6799
cheerful 6
look 14
her 181
better 7
with 34
than 22
Elizabeth 5
Now 10
she 199
that 11
this 6
first 8
meeting 6

over 596
I 4330

I 4330

on 86
one 19
side 74
of 109
her 181
mother 21
She 199
how 27
little 6
a 6799

to 805
or 333
make 17

She 199

Her 181

the 193
sense 8
of 109
what 14
they 5
him 9
more 11
painful 6
to 805
mind 25
and 51
she 199
would 5
at 272
times 10
have 11
given 3
anything 3
to 805
be 1200
to 805
tell 16
him 9
that 11
his 43
kindness 3

unknown 3
nor 102

the 193
whole 26

She 199

that 11
the 193

would 5
afford 6
some 30
of 109
them 9
together 3
that 11
the 193
whole 26
of 109
the 193
visit 14
would 5
not 85
pass 66
them 9
to 805
enter 23
into 26
something 3
more 11
of 109

than 22
the 193
mere 10
ceremonious 4
salutation 3

Anxious 4
and 51
the 193

dull 13

a 6799
degree 3
that 11
made 13
her 181
uncivil 3
She 199
forward 12
to 805
entrance 6
as 509
the 193
point 22
on 86
all 162
her 181
chance 20
of 109
pleasure 5
for 484
the 193

must 28
depend 17
If 8
he 962
does 5
not 85
come 36
to 805
me 1041
then 5
she 199
I 4330

The 193

she 199
thought 11
he 962
as 509

The 193

A 6799

Is 124

drawing 3
room 22
when 6
her 181
letter 20
was 93
she 199
saw 24
to 805
her 181
infinite 7
surprise 4
there 21
was 93
reason 13
to 805
fear 14
that 11
her 181
mother 21
had 11
too 50
ingenious 4
for 484
her 181
On 86
opening 3
the 193
door 41
she 199
her 181
sister 9
and 51
standing 3
together 3
over 596
the 193
hearth 8
as 509
if 8
in 2719
earnest 8
conversation 8
and 51
had 11
this 6
led 11
to 805
no 896
suspicion 3
the 193
of 109
both 8
as 509
they 5
round 29
and 51
other 5
would 5
have 11
it 67
all 162
situation 3
was 93
awkward 6
but 82
hers 9
she 199
thought 11
was 93
still 13
worse 6
Not 85
a 6799
syllable 3
was 93
by 57
and 51
Elizabeth 5
was 93
on 86
the 193
point 22
of 109
going 3
when 6
who 79
as 509
well 24
as 509
the 193
other 5
had 11
sat 92
down 90
rose 37
and 51
a 6799
few 6
words 5
to 805
her 181
sister 9
ran 110
out 365
of 109
the 193
room 22
Jane 8
have 11
no 896
Elizabeth 5
where 21
confidence 3
would 5
give 15
pleasure 5
and 51
her 181
with 34
the 193
emotion 12
that 11
she 199
was 93
the 193
creature 3
in 2719
the 193
world 12
too 50
she 199
by 57
far 91
too 50
I 4330
do 814
not 85
deserve 4
it 67
Oh 17
why 4
is 124
not 85
as 509
were 5
given 3
with 34
a 6799
a 6799
a 6799
delight 8
words 5
but 82
express 25
Every 10
sentence 4
of 109
kindness 3
was 93
a 6799
fresh 22
source 4
of 109
to 805
Jane 8
But 82
she 199
would 5
not 85
allow 9
to 805
stay 7
with 34
her 181
sister 9
or 333
say 7
half 23
that 11
to 805
be 1200
for 484
the 193
present 20
I 4330
must 28
go 500
to 805
my 90
mother 21
she 199
I 4330
would 5
not 85
on 86
any 17
account 14
trifle 7
with 34
her 181
or 333
allow 9
her 181
to 805
hear 76
it 67
but 82
He 962
is 124
gone 4
to 805
my 90
father 12
Oh 17
to 805
know 12
that 11
what 14
I 4330

pleasure 5
to 805
all 162
my 90
dear 15
how 27
shall 12
I 4330
bear 30
so 797
She 199
then 5
to 805
her 181
mother 21

that 11
had 11
given 3
them 9
so 797
of 109
suspense 3
and 51
vexation 3
And 51
this 6
she 199
is 124
the 193
end 92
of 109
all 162
his 43
anxious 4
of 109
all 162
his 43
falsehood 3
and 51
contrivance 3
the 193
most 3
reasonable 3
end 92
In 2719

He 962
then 5
shut 32

all 162
the 193

more 11
Then 5
her 181
daughter 4
Oh 17

dear 15
dear 15
Jane 8
I 4330
am 392

get 13
a 6799
wink 13
of 109
sleep 33
all 162
night 61
I 4330
how 27
it 67
would 5
be 1200
I 4330
it 67
must 28
be 1200
so 797
at 272
last 7
I 4330
was 93
sure 11
you 29
not 85
be 1200
so 797
for 484
nothing 5
I 4330
remember 4
as 509
soon 3
as 509
ever 33
I 4330
saw 24
him 9
when 6
he 962
first 8
came 36
into 26
last 7
year 19
I 4330
thought 11
how 27
it 67
was 93
that 11
you 29
should 7
come 36
together 3
Oh 17
he 962
is 124
the 193
young 9
man 342
that 11
ever 33
was 93
Lydia 4
were 5
all 162
Jane 8
was 93
competition 3
her 181
child 28
At 272
that 11
moment 14
she 199
for 484
no 896
other 5
Her 181
soon 3
to 805
make 17
interest 6
with 34
her 181
for 484
of 109
she 199
might 9
in 2719
future 3
be 1200
able 3
to 805
dispense 6
Mary 13
for 484
the 193
use 18
of 109
the 193
at 272
and 51
hard 70
for 484
a 6799
few 6
balls 7
there 21
every 10
winter 13
this 6
time 45
was 93
of 109
course 10
a 6799
visitor 3
at 272
coming 3
breakfast 5
and 51
till 14
after 48
supper 4
when 6
some 30
who 79
not 85
be 1200
had 11
given 3
him 9
an 970
invitation 6
to 805
dinner 9
he 962
thought 11
to 805
accept 16
Elizabeth 5
had 11
now 10
but 82
little 6
time 45
for 484
conversation 8
with 34
her 181
sister 9
for 484
while 4
he 962
was 93
present 20
Jane 8
had 11
no 896
attention 3
to 805
bestow 7
on 86
but 82
she 199
found 18
useful 4
to 805
both 8
of 109
them 9
in 2719
of 109
separation 3
that 11
must 28
occur 7
In 2719
the 193
absence 3
of 109
Jane 8
he 962
to 805
Elizabeth 5
for 484
the 193
pleasure 5
of 109
of 109
her 181
and 51
when 6
was 93
gone 4
Jane 8
the 193
same 5
of 109
relief 3
He 962
has 41
made 13
me 1041
so 797
she 199
one 19
evening 3
by 57
me 1041
that 11
he 962
was 93
of 109
my 90
being 3
in 2719
town 27
last 7
spring 23
I 4330
had 11
not 85
it 67
possible 3
I 4330
as 509
Elizabeth 5
But 82
how 27
did 23
he 962
account 14
for 484
it 67
It 67
must 28
have 11
his 43
doing 3
They 5
were 5
no 896
friends 4
to 805
his 43
acquaintance 5
with 34
me 1041
I 4330
wonder 17
at 272
since 7
he 962
might 9
have 11
so 797
more 11
in 2719
But 82
when 6
they 5
see 70
as 509
I 4330
trust 26
they 5
will 39
that 11
brother 9
is 124
with 34
me 1041
they 5
will 39
learn 9
to 805
be 1200
contented 4
and 51
we 444
shall 12
be 1200
on 86
good 28
though 12
we 444
can 287
never 3
be 1200
what 14
we 444
were 5
to 805
other 5
That 11
is 124
the 193
most 3
speech 13
Elizabeth 5
that 11
I 4330
ever 33
you 29
utter 10
Good 28
girl 14
It 67
would 5
vex 9
me 1041
to 805
see 70
you 29
the 193
dupe 7
of 109
Miss 71
regard 7
Would 5
you 29
believe 6
it 67
that 11
when 6
he 962
to 805
town 27
last 7
November 3
he 962
me 1041
and 51
nothing 5
but 82
a 6799
persuasion 3
of 109
my 90
being 3
would 5
have 11
his 43
coming 3
down 90
He 962
made 13
a 6799
little 6
mistake 5
to 805
be 1200
sure 11
but 82
it 67
is 124
to 805
the 193
credit 12
of 109
his 43
This 6
a 6799
panegyric 3
Jane 8
on 86
his 43
and 51
the 193
little 6
value 8
he 962
put 47
on 86
his 43
own 9
good 28
Elizabeth 5
was 93
to 805
find 10
that 11
he 962
had 11
not 85
the 193
of 109
his 43
friend 14
for 484
though 12
Jane 8
had 11
the 193
most 3
generous 4
and 51
heart 57
in 2719
the 193
world 12
she 199
it 67
was 93
a 6799
circumstance 4
must 28
prejudice 4
her 181

am 392
the 193
most 3
creature 3
that 11
ever 33
Jane 8
Oh 17
why 4
am 392
I 4330
my 90

If 8

you 29
as 509
If 8

good 28
luck 14

The 193

than 22
a 6799
slight 10
inclination 3
of 109

Lady 18

a 6799
short 62
silence 7
It 67
is 124
nothing 5
in 2719

of 109

Yes 16
well 24
I 4330
saw 24
them 9
the 193
night 61
last 7
Elizabeth 5
now 10
that 11
she 199
would 5
produce 7
a 6799
letter 20
for 484
her 181
Charlotte 4
as 509
it 67
the 193
probable 3
motive 4
for 484
her 181
calling 3
But 82
no 896
letter 20
and 51
she 199
was 93
with 34
great 12
her 181
ladyship 3
to 805
take 18
some 30
refreshment 4
but 82
Lady 18
and 51
not 85
anything 3
and 51
then 5
rising 3
up 194
to 805
Elizabeth 5
Miss 71
there 21
to 805
be 1200
a 6799
kind 31
of 109
a 6799
little 6
wilderness 3
on 86
one 19
side 74
of 109
your 4
lawn 6
I 4330
should 7
be 1200
glad 30
to 805
take 18
a 6799
turn 46
in 2719

if 8
you 29

your 4
Go 500

dear 15
her 181
mother 21
and 51
show 64
her 181
ladyship 3
the 193
different 11
I 4330
think 8
she 199
will 39
be 1200
with 34
the 193
hermitage 3
Elizabeth 5
and 51
into 26
her 181

her 181
noble 13

As 509

decent 8
on 86
Her 181

at 272
the 193

and 51
Elizabeth 5
saw 24
that 11
her 181

They 5
in 2719
silence 7
along 3
the 193
gravel 7
walk 25
that 11
led 11
to 805
the 193
copse 3
Elizabeth 5
was 93
to 805
make 17
no 896
effort 7
for 484
conversation 8
with 34
a 6799
woman 21
who 79
was 93
now 10
more 11
than 22
and 51
disagreeable 3
How 27
I 4330
ever 33
think 8
her 181
like 22
her 181
nephew 3
she 199
as 509
she 199
in 2719

As 509

You 29

of 109
my 90
journey 11
Your 4
own 9
heart 57
your 4
own 9
conscience 4
must 28
tell 16
you 29
why 4
I 4330
come 36
Elizabeth 5
with 34
you 29
are 12
Madam 5

for 484
the 193
of 109
you 29
here 31
Miss 71
her 181
ladyship 3
in 2719
an 970
tone 12
you 29
to 805
know 12
that 11
I 4330
am 392
not 85
to 805

But 82
you 29
may 49
choose 5
to 805
be 1200
you 29
shall 12
not 85
find 10

My 90
character 16
has 41
ever 33
for 484
and 51
and 51
in 2719
a 6799
cause 14
of 109
moment 14
as 509
this 6
I 4330
shall 12
not 85
depart 19
it 67
A 6799
report 12
of 109
a 6799
most 3
nature 3
me 1041
two 14
ago 15
I 4330
was 93
that 11
not 85
your 4
sister 9
was 93
on 86
the 193
point 22
of 109
being 3
most 3
married 3
but 82
that 11
you 29
that 11
Miss 71
Elizabeth 5
would 5
in 2719
all 162
likelihood 3
be 1200
soon 3
to 805
my 90
nephew 3
my 90
own 9
nephew 3
Mr 5
Though 12
I 4330
know 12
it 67
must 28
be 1200
a 6799
falsehood 3
though 12
I 4330
would 5
not 85
injure 6
him 9
so 797
as 509
to 805
suppose 4
the 193
truth 7
of 109
it 67
possible 3
I 4330
on 86
setting 3
off 100
for 484
this 6
place 29
that 11
I 4330
might 9
make 17
my 90
to 805
you 29
If 8
you 29

to 805
be 1200
true 9
Elizabeth 5
with 34
and 51
disdain 7
I 4330
wonder 17
you 29
the 193
trouble 18
of 109
coming 3
so 797
far 91
What 14
your 4

At 272

Your 4
coming 3
to 805
to 805

me 1041
and 51
my 90
Elizabeth 5
will 39
be 1200
a 6799
confirmation 3
of 109
it 67
if 8
a 6799
report 12

existence 3
If 8
Do 814
you 29
then 5
pretend 7
to 805
be 1200

Has 41

Do 814
you 29
not 85
know 12
that 11
a 6799
report 12
is 124
spread 12
I 4330
never 3
that 11
it 67
was 93
And 51
can 287
you 29
declare 6
that 11
there 21
is 124
no 896
foundation 3
for 484
it 67
I 4330
do 814
not 85
pretend 7
to 805
possess 16
equal 17
with 34
your 4
ladyship 3
You 29
may 49
ask 6
I 4330
shall 12
not 85
choose 5

This 6
is 124
not 85

it 67
to 805
be 1200
It 67

it 67
must 28
be 1200
so 797
while 4

the 193
use 18
of 109
his 43
reason 13
But 82
your 4
arts 4
and 51
may 49
in 2719
a 6799
moment 14
of 109
infatuation 3
have 11
made 13
him 9
forget 8
what 14
he 962

and 51
to 805
all 162
his 43
You 29
may 49
have 11
him 9
in 2719
If 8
I 4330
have 11
I 4330
shall 12
be 1200
the 193
last 7
person 33
to 805
confess 14
it 67
Miss 71
do 814
you 29
know 12
who 79
I 4330
am 392
I 4330
have 11
not 85

language 3
as 509
this 6
I 4330
am 392
the 193
relation 7

has 41
in 2719
the 193
world 12
and 51

Let 50

This 6

this 6
that 11
if 8

have 11
no 896
reason 13

me 1041
Lady 18

The 193

of 109
a 6799
peculiar 5
kind 31
they 5
have 11
intended 3
for 484

It 67
was 93
the 193

silence 7
My 90
daughter 4
and 51
my 90

They 5
are 12

the 193

the 193
same 5
noble 13
line 36
and 51
on 86
the 193
and 51
ancient 8
though 12
fortune 8
on 86
both 8
sides 23
is 124
splendid 4
They 5

other 5
by 57
the 193
voice 8
of 109
every 10
member 6
of 109

what 14

The 193

Is 124

be 1200
But 82
it 67
must 28
not 85
shall 12
not 85
be 1200
If 8
you 29
were 5
sensible 3
of 109
your 4
own 9
good 28
you 29
would 5
not 85
wish 13
to 805
quit 14
the 193
sphere 3
in 2719
you 29
have 11
up 194
In 2719
your 4
nephew 3
I 4330
should 7
not 85
consider 13
as 509
that 11
sphere 3
He 962
is 124
a 6799

I 4330
am 392
a 6799

your 4
mother 21
Who 79

imagine 3
me 1041
of 109
condition 13
my 90

Elizabeth 5
if 8
your 4
nephew 3

not 85
object 26
to 805
them 9
they 5
can 287
be 1200
nothing 5
to 805
you 29
Tell 16
me 1041
for 484
all 162
are 12
you 29

him 9
Though 12
Elizabeth 5
would 5
not 85

the 193
mere 10
purpose 12
of 109
Lady 18
have 11
this 6
question 16

not 85
but 82
say 7
after 48
a 6799
deliberation 3
I 4330
am 392

Lady 18
And 51

you 29
promise 4
me 1041
never 3

no 896
promise 4
of 109
the 193

Miss 71

I 4330
to 805
find 10
a 6799
more 11
reasonable 3
young 9
woman 21
But 82
do 814
not 85
deceive 6
into 26
a 6799
belief 3
that 11
I 4330
will 39
ever 33
recede 3
I 4330
shall 12
not 85
go 500
till 14
you 29
have 11
given 3
me 1041
the 193
assurance 3
I 4330
require 6
And 51
I 4330
never 3
shall 12
give 15
it 67
I 4330
am 392
not 85
to 805
be 1200
into 26
anything 3
so 797
unreasonable 3
Your 4
ladyship 3
Mr 5

your 4
daughter 4
but 82

make 17
marriage 6
at 272
all 162
more 11
probable 3
him 9
to 805
be 1200

me 1041
would 5
my 90

accept 16
his 43
hand 137
make 17
him 9
wish 13
to 805
bestow 7
it 67
on 86
his 43

Allow 9

Lady 18
that 11

How 27

Not 85

I 4330
have 11
by 57

To 805
all 162
the 193

It 67
is 124
well 24
You 29

You 29
refuse 4
to 805
obey 4
the 193
of 109

You 29
are 12
to 805
ruin 10
him 9
in 2719
the 193
opinion 4
of 109
all 162
his 43
friends 4
and 51
make 17
him 9
the 193
contempt 8
of 109
the 193
world 12
nor 102
nor 102
Elizabeth 5
have 11
any 17
possible 3
claim 12
on 86
me 1041
in 2719
the 193
present 20
instance 4
No 896
principle 4
of 109
would 5
be 1200
by 57
my 90
marriage 6
with 34
Mr 5
And 51
with 34
regard 7
to 805
the 193
resentment 3
of 109
his 43
or 333
the 193
of 109
the 193
world 12
if 8
the 193
former 3
were 5
by 57
his 43
me 1041
it 67
would 5
not 85
give 15
me 1041
one 19
concern 6
and 51
the 193
world 12
in 2719
general 22
would 5
have 11
too 50
sense 8
to 805
join 16
in 2719
the 193
scorn 10
And 51
this 6
is 124
your 4
real 47
opinion 4
This 6
is 124
your 4
final 18
resolve 5
well 24
I 4330
shall 12
now 10
know 12
how 27
to 805
act 69
Do 814
not 85
imagine 3
Miss 71
that 11
your 4
ambition 3
will 39
ever 33
be 1200
I 4330
came 36
to 805
try 12
you 29
I 4330
to 805
find 10
you 29
reasonable 3
but 82
depend 17
it 67
I 4330
will 39
carry 12
my 90
point 22
In 2719
this 6
manner 8
Lady 18
on 86
till 14
they 5
were 5
at 272
the 193
door 41
of 109
the 193
carriage 5
when 6
turning 3
round 29
she 199
I 4330
take 18
no 896
leave 14
of 109
you 29
Miss 71
I 4330
send 10
no 896
to 805
your 4
mother 21
You 29
deserve 4
no 896
attention 3
I 4330
am 392
most 3
Elizabeth 5
made 13
no 896
answer 8
and 51
to 805
persuade 6
her 181
ladyship 3
to 805
return 14
into 26
the 193
house 87
into 26
it 67
She 199
the 193
carriage 5
drive 18
as 509
she 199
up 194
Her 181
mother 21
met 180
her 181
at 272
the 193
door 41
of 109
the 193
dressing 3
room 22
to 805
ask 6
why 4
Lady 18
would 5
not 85
come 36
in 2719
and 51
rest 110
She 199
did 23
not 85
choose 5
it 67
her 181
daughter 4
she 199
would 5
go 500
She 199
is 124
a 6799
fine 17
woman 21
and 51
her 181
calling 3
here 31
was 93
civil 15
for 484
she 199
came 36
I 4330
suppose 4
to 805
tell 16
us 70
the 193
were 5
well 24
She 199
is 124
on 86
her 181
road 38
I 4330
dare 15
say 7
and 51
so 797
passing 3
through 4
thought 11
she 199
might 9
as 509
well 24
call 57
on 86
you 29
I 4330
suppose 4
she 199
had 11
nothing 5
particular 13
to 805
say 7
to 805
you 29
Elizabeth 5
was 93
to 805
give 15
into 26
a 6799
little 6
falsehood 3
here 31
for 484
to 805
acknowledge 3
the 193
substance 3
of 109
conversation 8
was 93
Chapter 3
The 193
of 109
this 6
visit 14
Elizabeth 5
into 26
not 85
be 1200
nor 102
she 199
for 484
learn 9
to 805
think 8

Lady 18
it 67
had 11
the 193
trouble 18
of 109
this 6
journey 11
for 484
the 193
sole 32
purpose 12
of 109
off 100
her 181
engagement 3
with 34
Mr 5
It 67
was 93
a 6799
rational 22
scheme 7
to 805
be 1200
sure 11
but 82
what 14
the 193
report 12
of 109
engagement 3
originate 3
Elizabeth 5
was 93
at 272
a 6799
loss 3
to 805
imagine 3
till 14
she 199
that 11
his 43
being 3
the 193
intimate 5
friend 14
of 109
and 51
her 181
being 3
the 193
sister 9
of 109
Jane 8
was 93
at 272
a 6799
time 45
when 6
the 193
expectation 3
of 109
one 19
wedding 3
made 13
eager 6
for 484
to 805
supply 3
the 193
idea 21
She 199
had 11
not 85
to 805
feel 11
that 11
the 193
marriage 6
of 109
her 181
sister 9
must 28
bring 6
them 9
more 11
together 3
And 51
her 181
at 272
Lodge 7
for 484
through 4
communication 3
with 34
the 193
the 193
report 12
she 199
had 11
Lady 18
had 11
set 40
that 11
down 90
as 509
certain 5
and 51
immediate 4
she 199
had 11
forward 12
to 805
as 509
possible 3
at 272
some 30
future 3
time 45
In 2719
Lady 18
she 199
not 85
help 23
feeling 4
some 30
as 509
to 805
the 193
possible 3
consequence 3
of 109
her 181
in 2719
this 6
what 14
she 199
had 11
of 109
her 181
resolution 3
to 805
prevent 13
marriage 6
it 67
to 805
Elizabeth 5
that 11
she 199
must 28
meditate 3
an 970
application 3
to 805
her 181
nephew 3
and 51
how 27
he 962
might 9
take 18
a 6799
similar 5
representation 4
of 109
the 193
to 805
a 6799
connection 3
with 34
her 181
she 199
dared 6
not 85
pronounce 7
She 199
not 85
the 193
exact 14
degree 3
of 109
his 43
affection 5
for 484
his 43
aunt 6
or 333
his 43
on 86
her 181
judgment 5
but 82
it 67
was 93
natural 18
to 805
suppose 4
that 11
he 962
thought 11
of 109
her 181
ladyship 3
than 22
she 199
do 814
and 51
it 67
was 93
certain 5
that 11
in 2719
the 193
of 109
a 6799
marriage 6
with 34
one 19
immediate 4
were 5
so 797
unequal 3
to 805
his 43
own 9
his 43
aunt 6
would 5
address 9
him 9
on 86
his 43
side 74
With 34
his 43
of 109
he 962
would 5
feel 11
that 11
the 193
to 805
Elizabeth 5
had 11
weak 20
and 51
ridiculous 4
good 28
sense 8
and 51
solid 21
If 8
he 962
had 11
as 509
to 805
what 14
he 962
should 7
do 814
had 11
often 4
the 193
and 51
of 109
so 797
near 15
a 6799
relation 7
might 9
settle 10
every 10
doubt 15
and 51
determine 7
him 9
at 272
to 805
be 1200
as 509
as 509
make 17
him 9
In 2719
that 11
case 25
he 962
would 5
return 14
no 896
more 11
Lady 18
might 9
see 70
him 9
in 2719
her 181
way 27
through 4
town 27
and 51
his 43
engagement 3
to 805
of 109
coming 3
to 805
must 28
give 15
way 27
If 8
an 970
excuse 4
for 484
not 85
his 43
promise 4
should 7
come 36
to 805
his 43
friend 14
within 3
a 6799
few 6
she 199
I 4330
shall 12
know 12
how 27
to 805
understand 8
it 67
I 4330
shall 12
then 5
give 15
over 596
every 10
expectation 3
every 10
wish 13
of 109
his 43
If 8
he 962
is 124
with 34
me 1041
when 6
he 962
might 9
have 11
my 90
and 51
hand 137
I 4330
shall 12
soon 3
cease 11
to 805
regret 9
him 9
at 272
all 162
The 193
surprise 4
of 109
the 193
rest 110
of 109
the 193
on 86
hearing 3
who 79
visitor 3
had 11
was 93
great 12
but 82
they 5
it 67
with 34
the 193
same 5
kind 31
of 109
supposition 3
had 11
and 51
Elizabeth 5
was 93
on 86
the 193
subject 11
The 193
morning 3
as 509
she 199
was 93
going 3
she 199
was 93
met 180
by 57
her 181
father 12
who 79
came 36
out 365
of 109
his 43
with 34
a 6799
letter 20
in 2719
his 43
hand 137
he 962
I 4330
was 93
going 3
to 805
look 14
for 484
you 29
come 36
into 26
my 90
room 22
She 199
him 9
and 51
her 181
to 805
know 12
what 14
he 962
had 11
to 805
tell 16
her 181
was 93
by 57
the 193
supposition 3
of 109
being 3
in 2719
some 30
manner 8
with 34
the 193
letter 20
he 962
It 67
her 181
that 11
it 67
might 9
be 1200
Lady 18
and 51
she 199
with 34
dismay 5
all 162
the 193
consequent 4
She 199
her 181
father 12
to 805
the 193
fire 103
place 29
and 51
they 5
both 8
sat 92
down 90
He 962
then 5
I 4330
have 11
a 6799
letter 20
this 6
morning 3
that 11
has 41
me 1041
As 509
it 67
you 29
to 805
know 12
I 4330
did 23
not 85
know 12
that 11
I 4330
had 11
two 14
on 86
the 193
brink 7
of 109
Let 50
me 1041
congratulate 3
you 29
on 86
a 6799
conquest 3
The 193
now 10
into 26
in 2719
the 193
conviction 3
of 109
being 3
a 6799
letter 20
the 193
nephew 3
of 109
the 193
aunt 6
and 51
she 199
was 93
most 3
to 805
be 1200
that 11
he 962
at 272
all 162
or 333
that 11
his 43
letter 20
was 93
not 85
to 805
when 6
her 181
father 12
You 29
look 14
conscious 5
Young 9
have 11
great 12
penetration 3
in 2719
as 509
these 4
but 82
I 4330
think 8
I 4330
may 49
even 36
your 4
to 805
discover 10
the 193
name 17
of 109
your 4
admirer 3
This 6
letter 20
is 124
Mr 5
Mr 5
and 51
what 14
can 287
he 962
have 11
to 805
say 7
Something 3
to 805
the 193
purpose 12
of 109
course 10
He 962
with 34
on 86
the 193
of 109
my 90
daughter 4
of 109
it 67
he 962
has 41
by 57
some 30
of 109
the 193
good 28
I 4330
shall 12
not 85
sport 36
with 34
your 4
impatience 3
by 57
reading 3
what 14
he 962
on 86
that 11
point 22
What 14
to 805
is 124
as 509
you 29
the 193
sincere 4
of 109
and 51
on 86
this 6
event 18
let 50
me 1041
now 10
add 54
a 6799
short 62
hint 13
on 86
the 193
subject 11
of 109
of 109
we 444
have 11
by 57
the 193
same 5
Your 4
daughter 4
Elizabeth 5
it 67
is 124
will 39
not 85
long 49
bear 30
the 193
name 17
of 109
after 48
her 181
elder 7
sister 9
has 41
it 67
and 51
the 193
partner 8
of 109
her 181
fate 8
may 49
be 1200
up 194
to 805
as 509
one 19
of 109
the 193
most 3
illustrious 4
in 2719
this 6
land 77
Can 287
you 29
guess 16
who 79
is 124
meant 3
by 57
this 6
young 9
gentleman 3
is 124
blessed 4
in 2719
a 6799
peculiar 5
way 27
with 34
every 10
thing 15
the 193
heart 57
of 109
mortal 6
can 287
most 3
desire 6
splendid 4
noble 13
and 51
extensive 4
patronage 3
Yet 4
in 2719
spite 10
of 109
all 162
these 4
let 50
me 1041
warn 8
my 90
cousin 3
Elizabeth 5
and 51
of 109
what 14
you 29
may 49
incur 12
by 57
a 6799
precipitate 5
closure 3
with 34
this 6
of 109
course 10
you 29
will 39
be 1200
to 805
take 18
immediate 4
advantage 6
of 109
Have 11
you 29
any 17
idea 21
who 79
this 6
gentleman 3
is 124
But 82
now 10
it 67
comes 4
out 365
motive 4
for 484
you 29
is 124
as 509
We 444
have 11
reason 13
to 805
imagine 3
that 11
his 43
aunt 6
Lady 18
de 2452
does 5
not 85
look 14
on 86
the 193
match 25
with 34
a 6799
eye 57
Mr 5
you 29
see 70
is 124
the 193
man 342
Now 10
I 4330
think 8
I 4330
have 11
you 29
he 962
or 333
the 193
have 11
on 86
any 17
man 342
within 3
the 193
circle 7
of 109
our 3
acquaintance 5
name 17
would 5
have 11
given 3
the 193
lie 31
more 11
to 805
what 14
they 5
related 3
Mr 5
who 79
never 3
at 272
any 17
woman 21
but 82
to 805
see 70
a 6799
blemish 5
and 51
who 79
never 3
at 272
you 29
in 2719
his 43
life 44
It 67
is 124
Elizabeth 5
to 805
join 16
in 2719
her 181
but 82
force 10
one 19
most 3
smile 7
Never 3
had 11
his 43
wit 77
in 2719
a 6799
manner 8
so 797
little 6
agreeable 3
to 805
her 181
Are 12
you 29
not 85
Oh 17
yes 16
Pray 9
read 49
on 86
the 193
likelihood 3
of 109
this 6
marriage 6
to 805
her 181
ladyship 3
last 7
night 61
she 199
with 34
her 181
usual 3
what 14
she 199
felt 5
on 86
the 193
occasion 7
when 6
it 67
that 11
on 86
the 193
score 19
of 109
some 30
on 86
the 193
part 102
of 109
my 90
cousin 3
she 199
would 5
never 3
give 15
her 181
consent 5
to 805
what 14
she 199
so 797
disgraceful 4
a 6799
match 25
I 4330
thought 11
it 67
my 90
to 805
give 15
the 193
of 109
this 6
to 805
my 90
cousin 3
that 11
she 199
and 51
her 181
noble 13
admirer 3
may 49
be 1200
aware 3
of 109
what 14
they 5
are 12
and 51
not 85
run 50
into 26
a 6799
marriage 6
has 41
not 85
Mr 5
am 392
that 11
my 90
cousin 3
sad 47
business 13
has 41
so 797
well 24
up 194
and 51
am 392
that 11
living 5
together 3
the 193
marriage 6
place 29
should 7
be 1200
so 797
I 4330
must 28
not 85
neglect 9
the 193
of 109
my 90
station 13
or 333
refrain 5
my 90
at 272
hearing 3
that 11
you 29
the 193
young 9
couple 7
into 26
your 4
house 87
as 509
soon 3
as 509
they 5
were 5
married 3
It 67
was 93
an 970
encouragement 3
of 109
vice 14
and 51
had 11
I 4330
the 193
rector 6
of 109
I 4330
should 7
have 11
it 67
You 29
to 805
forgive 8
them 9
as 509
a 6799
Christian 7
but 82
never 3
to 805
admit 7
them 9
in 2719
your 4
sight 17
or 333
allow 9
names 4
to 805
be 1200
in 2719
your 4
hearing 3
That 11
is 124
his 43
notion 5
of 109
Christian 7
The 193
rest 110
of 109
his 43
letter 20
is 124
his 43
dear 15
situation 3
and 51
his 43
expectation 3
of 109
a 6799
young 9
olive 6
branch 6
But 82
you 29
look 14
as 509
if 8
you 29
did 23
not 85
enjoy 9
it 67
You 29
are 12
not 85
going 3
to 805
be 1200
I 4330
hope 16
and 51
pretend 7
to 805
be 1200
at 272
an 970
idle 10
report 12
For 484
what 14
do 814
we 444
live 43
but 82
to 805
make 17
sport 36
for 484
our 3
and 51
laugh 14
at 272
them 9
in 2719
our 3
turn 46
Oh 17
Elizabeth 5
I 4330
am 392
But 82
it 67
is 124
so 797
strange 8
Yes 16
that 11
is 124
what 14
makes 4
it 67
Had 11
they 5
on 86
any 17
other 5

bear 30
so 797
for 484
the 193

If 8
you 29
will 39
thank 15
me 1041
he 962
let 50
it 67

That 11
the 193

attempt 5
to 805
But 82
your 4
owe 5
me 1041
nothing 5
as 509
I 4330
respect 18
them 9
I 4330
believe 6
I 4330
thought 11
of 109
you 29
Elizabeth 5
was 93
too 50
to 805
say 7
a 6799
word 26
After 48
a 6799
short 62
pause 4
her 181
companion 10
You 29
are 12
too 50
generous 4
to 805
trifle 7
with 34
me 1041
If 8
your 4

me 1041
so 797
at 272
My 90
and 51
are 12
but 82
one 19
word 26
you 29
will 39
silence 7
me 1041
on 86
this 6
subject 11
for 484
ever 33
Elizabeth 5
feeling 4
all 162
the 193
more 11
than 22
common 23
and 51
of 109
his 43
situation 3
now 10
to 805
speak 12
and 51
though 12
not 85
gave 4
him 9
to 805
understand 8
that 11
her 181
had 11
so 797
material 17
a 6799
change 21
since 7
the 193
period 16
to 805

as 509
to 805
make 17
her 181
receive 8
with 34
and 51
pleasure 5
his 43
present 20
The 193
this 6
reply 3
was 93
as 509
he 962
had 11
never 3
felt 5
and 51
he 962
on 86
the 193
occasion 7
as 509
and 51
as 509
as 509
a 6799
man 342
in 2719
love 29
can 287
be 1200
to 805
do 814
Had 11
Elizabeth 5
able 3
to 805
encounter 5
his 43
eye 57
she 199
might 9
have 11
how 27
well 24
the 193
expression 11
of 109
delight 8
over 596
his 43
face 19
him 9
but 82
though 12
she 199
not 85
look 14
she 199
listen 9
and 51
he 962
her 181
of 109
in 2719
of 109
what 14
she 199
was 93
to 805
him 9
made 13
his 43
affection 5
every 10
moment 14
more 11
valuable 3
They 5
on 86
knowing 3
in 2719
what 14
direction 5
There 21
was 93
too 50
to 805
be 1200
thought 11
and 51
felt 5
and 51
for 484
attention 3
to 805
any 17
other 5
She 199
soon 3
that 11
they 5
were 5
indebted 3
for 484
present 20
good 28
understanding 4
to 805
the 193
of 109
his 43
aunt 6
who 79
did 23
call 57
on 86
him 9
in 2719
her 181
return 14
through 4
London 5
and 51
there 21
relate 8
her 181
journey 11
to 805
motive 4
and 51
the 193
substance 3
of 109
her 181
conversation 8
with 34
Elizabeth 5
dwelling 3
on 86
every 10
expression 11
of 109
the 193
latter 3
in 2719
her 181
apprehension 3
her 181
and 51
assurance 3
in 2719
the 193
belief 3
that 11
a 6799
relation 7
must 28
assist 10
her 181
to 805
obtain 7
that 11
promise 4
her 181
nephew 3
she 199
had 11
to 805
give 15
But 82
for 484
her 181
ladyship 3
effect 15
had 11
It 67
me 1041
to 805
hope 16
he 962
as 509
I 4330
had 11
ever 33
to 805
hope 16
I 4330
of 109
your 4
disposition 3
to 805
be 1200
certain 5
that 11
had 11
you 29
me 1041
you 29
would 5
have 11
it 67
to 805
Lady 18
and 51
Elizabeth 5
and 51
as 509
she 199
Yes 16
you 29
know 12
of 109
my 90
to 805
believe 6
me 1041
of 109
that 11
After 48
you 29
so 797
to 805
your 4
face 19
I 4330
have 11
no 896
scruple 4
in 2719
you 29
to 805
all 162
your 4
relations 4
What 14
did 23
you 29
say 7
of 109
me 1041
that 11
I 4330
did 23
not 85
deserve 4
For 484
though 12
your 4
were 5
ill 84
on 86
my 90
to 805
you 29
at 272
the 193
time 45
had 11
the 193
reproof 5
It 67
was 93
I 4330
think 8
of 109
it 67
We 444
will 39
not 85
quarrel 11
for 484
the 193
share 22
of 109
blame 12
to 805
that 11
evening 3
Elizabeth 5
The 193
conduct 21
of 109
if 8
will 39
be 1200
but 82
since 7
then 5
we 444
have 11
both 8
I 4330
hope 16
in 2719
I 4330
be 1200
so 797
to 805
The 193
recollection 3
of 109
what 14
I 4330
then 5
of 109
my 90
conduct 21
my 90
my 90
the 193
whole 26
of 109
it 67
is 124
now 10
and 51
has 41
painful 6
to 805
me 1041
Your 4
reproof 5
so 797
well 24
I 4330
shall 12
never 3
forget 8
you 29
in 2719
a 6799
more 11
manner 8
were 5
your 4
words 5
You 29
know 12
not 85
you 29
can 287
conceive 3
how 27
they 5
have 11
me 1041
though 12
it 67
was 93
some 30
time 45
I 4330
confess 14
I 4330
was 93
reasonable 3
to 805
allow 9
justice 3
I 4330
was 93
far 91
them 9
to 805
make 17
so 797
strong 16
an 970
impression 12
I 4330
had 11
not 85
the 193
idea 21
of 109
being 3
ever 33
felt 5
in 2719
a 6799
way 27
I 4330
can 287
believe 6
it 67
You 29
thought 11
me 1041
then 5
of 109
every 10
proper 9
feeling 4
I 4330
am 392
sure 11
you 29
did 23
The 193
turn 46
of 109
your 4
countenance 4
I 4330
shall 12
never 3
forget 8
as 509
you 29
that 11
I 4330
not 85
have 11
you 29
in 2719
any 17
possible 3
way 27
that 11
would 5
induce 9
you 29
to 805
accept 16
me 1041
Oh 17
do 814
not 85
repeat 12
what 14
I 4330
then 5
These 4
will 39
not 85
do 814
at 272
all 162
I 4330
assure 6
you 29
that 11
I 4330
have 11
long 49
most 3
of 109
it 67
his 43
letter 20
Did 23
it 67
he 962
did 23
it 67
soon 3
make 17
you 29
think 8
better 7
of 109
me 1041
Did 23
you 29
on 86
reading 3
it 67
give 15
any 17
credit 12
to 805
She 199
what 14
effect 15
on 86
her 181
had 11
and 51
how 27
all 162
her 181
former 3
had 11
I 4330
he 962
that 11
what 14
I 4330
must 28
give 15
you 29
pain 42
but 82
it 67
was 93
I 4330
hope 16
you 29
have 11
the 193
letter 20
There 21
was 93
one 19
part 102
the 193
opening 3
of 109
it 67
I 4330
should 7
dread 14
your 4
the 193
power 19
of 109
reading 3
I 4330
can 287
remember 4
some 30
might 9
make 17
you 29
hate 14
me 1041
The 193
letter 20
shall 12
be 1200
if 8
you 29
believe 6
it 67
essential 4
to 805
the 193
preservation 5
of 109
my 90
regard 7
but 82
though 12
we 444
have 11
both 8
reason 13
to 805
think 8
my 90
not 85
they 5
are 12
not 85
I 4330
hope 16
so 797
as 509
that 11
When 6
I 4330
that 11
letter 20
I 4330
calm 10
and 51
cool 22
but 82
I 4330
am 392
since 7
that 11
it 67
was 93
in 2719
a 6799
dreadful 4
of 109
spirit 20
The 193
letter 20
in 2719
but 82
it 67
did 23
not 85
end 92
so 797
The 193
adieu 3
is 124
But 82
think 8
no 896
more 11
of 109
the 193
letter 20
The 193
of 109
the 193
person 33
who 79
and 51
the 193
person 33
who 79
it 67
are 12
now 10
so 797
different 11
what 14
they 5
were 5
then 5
that 11
every 10
unpleasant 4
circumstance 4
it 67
to 805
be 1200
You 29
must 28
learn 9
some 30
of 109
my 90
Think 8
of 109
the 193
past 71
as 509
remembrance 3
you 29
pleasure 5
I 4330
give 15
you 29
credit 12
for 484
any 17
of 109
the 193
kind 31
Your 4
must 28
be 1200
so 797
void 6
of 109
reproach 8
that 11
the 193
them 9
is 124
not 85
of 109
but 82
what 14
is 124
better 7
of 109
But 82
with 34
me 1041
it 67
is 124
not 85
so 797
Painful 6
will 39
intrude 6
not 85
to 805
be 1200
I 4330
have 11
a 6799
selfish 4
being 3
all 162
my 90
life 44
in 2719
practice 4
though 12
not 85
in 2719
principle 4
As 509
a 6799
child 28
I 4330
was 93
what 14
was 93
right 31
but 82
I 4330
was 93
not 85
to 805
correct 18
my 90
temper 22
I 4330
was 93
given 3
good 28
but 82
left 19
to 805
follow 11
them 9
in 2719
pride 6
and 51
conceit 7
an 970
son 70
for 484
an 970
child 28
I 4330
was 93
by 57
my 90
who 79
though 12
good 28
my 90
father 12
all 162
that 11
was 93
and 51
me 1041
to 805
be 1200
selfish 4
and 51
to 805
care 47
for 484
none 32
my 90
own 9
circle 7
to 805
think 8
of 109
all 162
the 193
rest 110
of 109
the 193
world 12
to 805
wish 13
at 272
least 3
to 805
think 8
of 109
sense 8
and 51
worth 15
with 34
my 90
own 9
I 4330
was 93
eight 18
to 805
eight 18
and 51
and 51
I 4330
might 9
still 13
have 11
but 82
for 484
you 29
Elizabeth 5
What 14
do 814
I 4330
not 85
owe 5
you 29
You 29
me 1041
a 6799
lesson 3
hard 70
at 272
first 8
but 82
most 3
By 57
you 29
I 4330
was 93
I 4330
came 36
to 805
you 29
a 6799
doubt 15
of 109
my 90
reception 6
You 29
me 1041
how 27
were 5
all 162
my 90
to 805
please 3
a 6799
woman 21
of 109
being 3
Had 11
you 29
then 5
that 11
I 4330
should 7
I 4330
had 11
What 14
will 39
you 29
think 8
of 109
my 90
I 4330
you 29
to 805
be 1200
my 90
My 90
must 28
have 11
in 2719
fault 20
but 82
not 85
I 4330
assure 6
you 29
I 4330
never 3
meant 3
to 805
deceive 6
you 29
but 82
my 90
might 9
often 4
lead 15
me 1041
wrong 24
How 27
you 29
must 28
have 11
me 1041
after 48
that 11
evening 3
Hate 14
you 29
I 4330
was 93
at 272
first 8
but 82
my 90
anger 5
soon 3
to 805
take 18
a 6799
proper 9
direction 5
I 4330
am 392
of 109
what 14
you 29
thought 11
of 109
me 1041
when 6
we 444
met 180
at 272
You 29
me 1041
for 484
coming 3
No 896
I 4330
felt 5
nothing 5
but 82
surprise 4
Your 4
surprise 4
not 85
be 1200
than 22
mine 26
in 2719
being 3
by 57
you 29
My 90
conscience 4
me 1041
that 11
I 4330
no 896
and 51
I 4330
confess 14
that 11
I 4330
did 23
not 85
expect 20
to 805
receive 8
more 11
than 22
my 90
due 21
My 90
object 26
then 5
was 93
to 805
show 64
you 29
by 57
every 10
in 2719
my 90
power 19
that 11
I 4330
was 93
not 85
so 797
mean 36
as 509
to 805
resent 11
the 193
past 71
and 51
I 4330
to 805
obtain 7
your 4

lessen 4
your 4
ill 84
opinion 4
by 57

see 70
that 11
your 4
had 11
to 805
How 27
soon 3
any 17
other 5
I 4330
can 287
tell 16
but 82
I 4330
believe 6
in 2719
half 23
an 970
hour 10
after 48
I 4330
had 11
you 29
He 962
then 5
her 181
of 109
delight 8
in 2719
her 181
acquaintance 5
and 51
of 109
her 181
disappointment 3
at 272
sudden 4
interruption 3
to 805
the 193
cause 14
of 109
that 11
interruption 3
she 199
soon 3
that 11
his 43
resolution 3
of 109
following 3
her 181
in 2719
quest 21
of 109
her 181
sister 9
had 11
he 962
the 193
inn 59
and 51
that 11
his 43
and 51
there 21
had 11
no 896
other 5
than 22
what 14
a 6799
purpose 12
must 28
comprehend 4
She 199
her 181
but 82
it 67
was 93
too 50
painful 6
a 6799
subject 11
to 805
to 805
be 1200
on 86
After 48
several 3
miles 4
in 2719
a 6799
manner 8
and 51
too 50
busy 9
to 805
know 12
anything 3
it 67
they 5
found 18
at 272
last 7
on 86
that 11
it 67
was 93
time 45
to 805
be 1200
at 272
home 90
What 14
of 109
Mr 5
and 51
Jane 8
was 93
a 6799
wonder 17
the 193
discussion 3
of 109
was 93
with 34
engagement 3
his 43
friend 14
had 11
given 3
him 9
the 193
information 3
of 109
it 67
I 4330
must 28
ask 6
you 29
were 5
Elizabeth 5
Not 85
at 272
all 162
When 6
I 4330
I 4330
felt 5
that 11
it 67
would 5
soon 3
happen 9
That 11
is 124
to 805
say 7
you 29
had 11
given 3
your 4
permission 3
I 4330
as 509
And 51
though 12
he 962
at 272
the 193
term 34
she 199
found 18
that 11
it 67
had 11
pretty 3
the 193
case 25
On 86
the 193
evening 3
my 90
going 3
to 805
London 5
he 962
I 4330
made 13
a 6799
confession 6
to 805
him 9
I 4330
believe 6
I 4330
to 805
have 11
made 13
long 49
ago 15
I 4330
him 9
of 109
all 162
that 11
had 11
to 805
make 17
my 90
former 3
in 2719
his 43
absurd 9
and 51
His 43
surprise 4
was 93
great 12
He 962
had 11
never 3
had 11
the 193
suspicion 3
I 4330
him 9
that 11
I 4330
in 2719
as 509
I 4330
had 11
done 3
that 11
your 4
sister 9
was 93
to 805
him 9
and 51
as 509
I 4330
perceive 3
that 11
his 43
attachment 3
to 805
her 181
was 93
I 4330
felt 5
no 896
doubt 15
of 109
together 3
Elizabeth 5
not 85
help 23
at 272
his 43
manner 8
of 109
his 43
friend 14
Did 23
you 29
speak 12
your 4
own 9
observation 4
she 199
when 6
you 29

my 90
sister 9

or 333
my 90

last 7
spring 23
the 193
former 3

had 11
her 181
the 193
two 14
I 4330
had 11
made 13
here 31
and 51
I 4330
was 93
of 109
her 181
affection 5
And 51
your 4
assurance 3
of 109
it 67
I 4330
suppose 4
immediate 4
conviction 3
to 805
him 9
It 67
did 23
is 124
most 3
modest 5
His 43
had 11
his 43
on 86
his 43
own 9
judgment 5
in 2719
so 797
anxious 4
a 6799
case 25
but 82
his 43
on 86
mine 26
made 13
every 10
thing 15
I 4330
was 93
to 805
confess 14
one 19
thing 15
for 484
a 6799
time 45
and 51
not 85
him 9
I 4330
not 85
allow 9
to 805
conceal 10
that 11
your 4
sister 9
had 11
in 2719
town 27
three 12
last 7
winter 13
that 11
I 4330
had 11
it 67
and 51
it 67
him 9
He 962
was 93
But 82
his 43
anger 5
I 4330
am 392
no 896
than 22
he 962
in 2719
any 17
doubt 15
of 109
your 4
He 962
has 41
forgiven 3
me 1041
now 10
Elizabeth 5
to 805
observe 6
that 11
Mr 5
had 11
a 6799
most 3
friend 14
so 797
that 11
his 43
worth 15
was 93
but 82
she 199
She 199
that 11
he 962
had 11
yet 4
to 805
learn 9
to 805
be 1200
at 272
and 51
it 67
was 93
too 50
to 805
begin 8
In 2719
the 193

all 162
the 193
when 6
they 5

down 90
to 805
table 27
She 199
had 11
to 805
say 7
in 2719
reply 3
that 11
they 5
had 11
till 14
she 199
was 93
her 181

knowledge 4
She 199
as 509

spoke 14
but 82
that 11
nor 102
anything 3
a 6799
suspicion 3
of 109
the 193
truth 7
The 193
evening 3
by 57
anything 3
The 193
and 51
the 193

silent 6
was 93
not 85
of 109
a 6799
disposition 3
in 2719
in 2719
mirth 8
and 51
Elizabeth 5
and 51
that 11
she 199
was 93

felt 5
to 805
be 1200
so 797
for 484
the 193
immediate 4
embarrassment 3
there 21
were 5
other 5
her 181
She 199
what 14
would 5
be 1200
felt 5
in 2719
the 193
when 6
her 181
situation 3
she 199
was 93
aware 3
that 11
no 896
one 19
him 9
but 82
Jane 8
and 51
even 36
that 11
with 34
the 193

was 93
a 6799
dislike 4
not 85
all 162
his 43
fortune 8
and 51
consequence 3
might 9
do 814
At 272
night 61
she 199
her 181
heart 57
to 805
Jane 8
Though 12
suspicion 3
was 93
far 91
Miss 71
general 22
she 199
was 93
here 31
You 29

This 6

Mr 5
No 896

not 85
deceive 6
me 1041
I 4330
know 12
it 67
to 805
be 1200
This 6
is 124
a 6799
wretched 6
beginning 3
My 90
sole 32
was 93
on 86
you 29
and 51
I 4330
am 392
sure 11
will 39
believe 6
me 1041
if 8
you 29
do 814
not 85
Yet 4
I 4330
am 392
in 2719
earnest 8
I 4330
speak 12
nothing 5
but 82
the 193
truth 7
He 962
still 13
me 1041
and 51
we 444
are 12
Jane 8
at 272
her 181
Oh 17
it 67
be 1200
I 4330
know 12
how 27
you 29
dislike 4
him 9
You 29
know 12
nothing 5
of 109
the 193
matter 7
That 11
is 124
all 162
to 805
be 1200
I 4330
did 23
not 85
love 29
him 9
so 797
well 24
as 509
I 4330
do 814
now 10
But 82
in 2719
as 509
these 4
a 6799

This 6

shall 12
ever 33
remember 4
it 67
Miss 71
still 13
all 162
Elizabeth 5
and 51
more 11
assured 4
her 181
of 109
truth 7
Good 28
Heaven 9
can 287
it 67
be 1200
so 797
Yet 4
now 10
I 4330
must 28
believe 6

But 82
I 4330
believe 6
I 4330

it 67
my 90
first 8
his 43
grounds 10
at 272
that 11

she 199
soon 3
Jane 8
by 57

When 6

you 29
I 4330
must 28
have 11
him 9
but 82

How 27

Elizabeth 5

unwilling 4
to 805
mention 5
and 51
the 193
state 41
of 109
her 181

had 11
made 13
her 181
avoid 8
the 193

of 109
his 43

But 82

All 162

Good 28

if 8
that 11
disagreeable 3
Mr 5

with 34
our 3

What 14
can 287
he 962
mean 36
by 57
being 3
so 797
tiresome 4
as 509
to 805
be 1200
coming 3
here 31
I 4330
had 11
no 896
notion 5

shooting 3

walk 25
out 365
with 34
him 9
that 11

not 85
be 1200
in 2719
way 27
Elizabeth 5
help 23
laughing 6
at 272

was 93
that 11
her 181
mother 21

As 509

view 18
It 67
may 49
do 814
well 24
for 484
the 193
Mr 5
but 82
I 4330
am 392
sure 11
it 67
will 39
be 1200
too 50
for 484
it 67
that 11
she 199
had 11
stay 7
at 272
home 90
a 6799
great 12
to 805
see 70

As 509

have 11
that 11
disagreeable 3
man 342

But 82
I 4330
hope 16
you 29
will 39
not 85
mind 25
it 67
it 67
is 124
all 162
for 484
you 29

and 51
there 21
is 124
no 896
occasion 7
for 484
to 805
him 9
except 10
just 24
now 10
and 51
then 5
So 797
do 814
not 85
put 47
to 805
inconvenience 4
walk 25
it 67
was 93
that 11
Mr 5

should 7
be 1200
in 2719
the 193
course 10
of 109

Elizabeth 5

She 199

But 82

were 5
set 40
the 193
match 25
or 333
with 34
it 67
it 67
was 93
certain 5
that 11
her 181
manner 8
would 5
be 1200
ill 84
to 805
do 814
credit 12
to 805
her 181
sense 8
and 51
she 199
no 896
more 11
bear 30
that 11
Mr 5
should 7
hear 76
the 193
first 8
of 109

was 93
extreme 8
She 199
did 23
not 85

but 82
he 962
was 93
going 3
to 805
be 1200
made 13
and 51
that 11

till 14
Mr 5
when 6
at 272

It 67
would 5
have 11

was 93
awkward 6
to 805
give 15
but 82
they 5
were 5
now 10
and 51
she 199
assured 4
him 9
with 34
some 30
confusion 3
of 109

Mr 5
Or 333

a 6799
proud 5
unpleasant 4
sort 14
of 109
man 342
but 82

He 962

the 193
kind 31
of 109
man 342

whom 3
I 4330

to 805
him 9
as 509
a 6799

Your 4

place 29

the 193
danger 7

You 29
escape 10
discredit 7
and 51
My 90

let 50
me 1041
not 85
have 11
the 193
grief 3
of 109

to 805
respect 18
your 4
partner 8
in 2719
life 44
You 29

had 11
her 181
absolute 7
that 11

was 93
not 85
the 193

Well 24

So 797
the 193
better 7
It 67
will 39
save 7
me 1041
a 6799
world 12
of 109
trouble 18
and 51
Had 11

you 29

there 21
will 39
be 1200
an 970

after 48
half 23
an 970
quiet 20
reflection 3
in 2719
her 181
own 9

was 93
able 3
to 805
join 16
the 193

Every 10
thing 15
was 93
too 50
recent 6
for 484
but 82
the 193
evening 3
there 21
was 93
no 896
anything 3

the 193
comfort 14
of 109

When 6

Nor 102

the 193

Oh 17

Dear 15

A 6799

Every 10

Three 12

Ten 151

Oh 17
Lord 13
What 14
will 39
of 109
me 1041
I 4330
shall 12
go 500
This 6
was 93
to 805
prove 21
that 11
her 181
approbation 3
need 29
not 85
be 1200
and 51
Elizabeth 5
rejoicing 3
that 11
an 970
effusion 3
was 93
by 57
soon 3
But 82
she 199
had 11
three 12

My 90

Ten 151

year 19
and 51
more 11
as 509
good 28
as 509
a 6799
Lord 13
And 51
a 6799
special 19
You 29
must 28
and 51
shall 12
be 1200
married 3
by 57
a 6799
special 19
But 82
my 90
love 29
tell 16
me 1041
what 14
dish 52
Mr 5
is 124
fond 17
of 109
that 11
I 4330
may 49
have 11
it 67
to 805
morrow 3
This 6
was 93
a 6799
sad 47
omen 3
of 109
what 14
her 181
to 805
the 193
gentleman 3
might 9
be 1200
and 51
Elizabeth 5
found 18
that 11
though 12
in 2719
the 193
certain 5
possession 3
of 109
his 43
affection 5
and 51
secure 6
of 109
her 181
consent 5
there 21
was 93
still 13
something 3
to 805
be 1200
for 484
But 82
the 193
morrow 3
off 100
better 7
than 22
she 199
for 484
in 2719
awe 10
of 109
her 181
intended 3
son 70
in 2719
law 45
that 11
she 199
not 85
to 805
speak 12
to 805
him 9
it 67
was 93
in 2719
her 181
power 19
to 805
offer 10
him 9
any 17
attention 3
or 333
mark 47
her 181
for 484
his 43
opinion 4
Elizabeth 5
had 11
the 193
satisfaction 3
of 109
her 181
father 12
taking 4
pains 4
to 805
get 13
with 34
him 9
and 51
Mr 5
soon 3
assured 4
her 181
that 11
he 962
was 93
rising 3
every 10
hour 10
in 2719
his 43
esteem 5
I 4330
admire 6
all 162
my 90
three 12
in 2719
law 45
he 962
is 124
my 90
but 82
I 4330
think 8
I 4330
shall 12
like 22
your 4
husband 10
as 509
well 24
as 509
Chapter 3
soon 3
rising 3
to 805
she 199
Mr 5
to 805
account 14
for 484
his 43
ever 33
in 2719
love 29
with 34
her 181
How 27
you 29
begin 8
she 199
I 4330
can 287
comprehend 4
your 4
going 3
on 86
when 6
you 29
had 11
made 13
a 6799
beginning 3
but 82
what 14
set 40
you 29
off 100
in 2719
the 193
first 8
place 29
I 4330
fix 27
on 86
the 193
hour 10
or 333
the 193
spot 24
or 333
the 193
look 14
or 333
the 193
words 5
the 193
foundation 3
It 67
is 124
too 50
long 49
ago 15
I 4330
was 93
in 2719
the 193
middle 14
I 4330
that 11
I 4330
had 11
My 90
you 29
had 11
and 51
as 509
for 484
my 90
my 90
to 805
you 29
was 93
at 272
least 3
on 86
the 193
uncivil 3
and 51
I 4330
never 3
spoke 14
to 805
you 29
to 805
give 15
you 29
pain 42
than 22
not 85
Now 10
be 1200
sincere 4
did 23
you 29
admire 6
me 1041
for 484
my 90
impertinence 3
For 484
the 193
of 109
your 4
mind 25
I 4330
did 23
You 29
may 49
as 509
well 24
call 57
it 67
impertinence 3
at 272
It 67
was 93
little 6
less 19
The 193
fact 35
is 124
that 11
you 29
were 5
sick 38
of 109
of 109
of 109
officious 4
attention 3
You 29
were 5
with 34
the 193
women 5
who 79
were 5
and 51
and 51
for 484
your 4
approbation 3
I 4330
and 51
you 29
I 4330
was 93
so 797
unlike 10
them 9
Had 11
you 29
not 85
you 29
would 5
have 11
me 1041
for 484
it 67
but 82
in 2719
spite 10
of 109
the 193
pains 4
you 29
to 805
disguise 4
your 4
were 5
noble 13
and 51
just 24
and 51
in 2719
your 4
heart 57
you 29
the 193
who 79
so 797
you 29
There 21
I 4330
have 11
you 29
the 193
trouble 18
of 109
for 484
it 67
and 51
all 162
I 4330
begin 8
to 805
think 8
it 67
reasonable 3
To 805
be 1200
sure 11
you 29
no 896
actual 11
good 28
of 109
me 1041
but 82
of 109
that 11
when 6
they 5
fall 29
in 2719
love 29
Was 93
there 21
no 896
good 28
in 2719
your 4
to 805
Jane 8
while 4
she 199
was 93
ill 84
at 272
Jane 8
who 79
have 11
done 3
less 19
for 484
her 181
But 82
make 17
a 6799
virtue 3
of 109
it 67
by 57
all 162
My 90
good 28
are 12
under 288
your 4
protection 8
and 51
you 29
are 12
to 805
exaggerate 4
them 9
as 509
as 509
possible 3
and 51
in 2719
return 14
it 67
to 805
me 1041
to 805
find 10
for 484
and 51
with 34
you 29
as 509
often 4
as 509
may 49
be 1200
and 51
I 4330
shall 12
begin 8
by 57
you 29
what 14
made 13
you 29
so 797
unwilling 4
to 805
come 36
to 805
the 193
point 22
at 272
last 7
What 14
made 13
you 29
so 797
shy 14
of 109
me 1041
when 6
you 29
first 8
and 51
here 31
Why 4
when 6
you 29
did 23
you 29
look 14
as 509
if 8
you 29
did 23
not 85
care 47
me 1041
you 29
were 5
grave 28
and 51
silent 6
and 51
gave 4
me 1041
no 896
encouragement 3
But 82
I 4330
was 93
And 51
so 797
was 93
I 4330
You 29
might 9
have 11
to 805
me 1041
more 11
when 6
you 29
came 36
to 805
dinner 9
A 6799
man 342
who 79
had 11
felt 5
less 19
might 9
How 27
that 11
you 29
should 7
have 11
a 6799
reasonable 3
answer 8
to 805
give 15
and 51
that 11
I 4330
should 7
be 1200
so 797
reasonable 3
as 509
to 805
admit 7
it 67
But 82
I 4330
wonder 17
how 27
long 49
you 29
would 5
have 11
gone 4
on 86
if 8
you 29
had 11
left 19
to 805
I 4330
wonder 17
when 6
you 29
would 5
have 11
if 8
I 4330
had 11
not 85
you 29
My 90
resolution 3
of 109
you 29
for 484
your 4
kindness 3
to 805
Lydia 4
had 11
great 12
effect 15
Too 50
I 4330
am 392
for 484
what 14
of 109
the 193
moral 25
if 8
our 3
comfort 14
springs 3
a 6799
breach 5
of 109
promise 4
for 484
I 4330
not 85
to 805
have 11
the 193
subject 11
This 6
will 39
never 3
do 814
You 29
need 29
not 85
distress 7
The 193
moral 25
will 39
be 1200
fair 25
Lady 18
to 805
separate 7
us 70
were 5
the 193
of 109
all 162
my 90
I 4330
am 392
not 85
indebted 3
for 484
my 90
present 20
to 805
your 4
eager 6
desire 6
of 109
your 4
I 4330
was 93
not 85
in 2719
a 6799
to 805
wait 19
for 484
any 17
opening 3
of 109
yours 3
My 90
had 11
given 3
me 1041
hope 16
and 51
I 4330
was 93
at 272
to 805
know 12
every 10
thing 15
Lady 18
has 41
of 109
infinite 7
use 18
to 805
make 17
her 181
for 484
she 199
to 805
be 1200
of 109
use 18
But 82
tell 16
me 1041
what 14
did 23
you 29
come 36
down 90
to 805
for 484
Was 93
it 67
to 805
ride 9
to 805
and 51
be 1200
or 333
had 11
you 29
intended 3
any 17
more 11
serious 4
consequence 3
My 90
real 47
purpose 12
was 93
to 805
see 70
you 29
and 51
to 805
judge 6
if 8
I 4330
I 4330
might 9
ever 33
hope 16
to 805
make 17
you 29
love 29
me 1041
My 90
one 19
or 333
what 14
I 4330
to 805
was 93
to 805
see 70
your 4
sister 9
were 5
still 13
partial 6
to 805
and 51

Shall 12

And 51
if 8
I 4330
had 11
not 85
a 6799

though 12
in 2719
the 193

who 79
might 9
not 85
have 11

in 2719
so 797

The 193
